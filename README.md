# Gratitude Maximizer
Within the context of a data science bootcamp for the final project I decided to perform a sentiment analysis of YouTube comments, trying to detect gratitude, with the idea of recommending videos to users where people felt more grateful after having watched these videos.

In order to realize this we have trained an CNN-LSTM hybrid model with a self-built labeled training set of around 40,000 comments.

We used our trained model to analyze the most subscribed and popular YouTube channels and calculated their respective gratitude score.

To build the recommender system we have used the easy to use Streamlit app.

Our results are shown in the presentation:
