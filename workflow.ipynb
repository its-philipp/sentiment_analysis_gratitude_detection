fasting is good one must get rid of short term gratification one must think of effort itself as the reward don t get any dopamine highs before and after effort so that you ll have a decent amount of base dopamine when you arrive to effort and you won t crave for any other things that d come after effort if you do all these the effort itself is gonna be the thing that you crave for pretty much

can t thank you enough for this lecture and all your other content i ve watched a lot and seen you on the ymh podcasts too it s so selfless that you spend so much time making this content to just give to the masses i feel like i ve learned so much from this i have adhd and i ve been on quite the journey i didnt like being on the meds after a few years of it and have largely taught myself to keep it in check without being medicated but every couple of weeks i need to crash and have some down days as it s hard to hold that line for extended periods of time i now understand why and i now have some things to try to manage that i have now worked up the courage to watch your adhd lecture been avoiding it no idea why thanks again   \n","813

building blocks we are able to optimize how we use that dopa but cannot increase the actual amount thanks   \n","863   yeah you missed something you need the nutrients to create dopamine and serotonin in the first place so if you want an abundance and a quick pooling of dopamine recovery you need the stuff to create it in the first place i feel a huge difference after looking into this i can get a huge rush of dopamine release just by listening to music now and it doesnt even feel like a crash afterwards cause the body is able to create so much of it i recomend researching what nutrients dopamine needs hint its basically all of them just get all the nutrients the body needs and u need to research which nutrients those are and where u get them from i found this after i had a whole year of depression cause of a folate deficiency if youre deficient in something that is needed for dopamine then you will have low no matter what magnesium deficiency makes dopamine low too just research and get everything and you wil feel awesome   \n","579

ba in neuropsychology but this video filled in a lot of blanks for me with great details and was a great refresher from my college years dont listen to people who say he is a quack many of the studies he uses here i remember learning about in college he uses a mix of established peer reviewed data and also suggests emerging ideas based on new studies in the field overall dr h is very well informed

towards energy drinks those things keep me alive unfortunately br br for your situation try sugar free energy drinks and you won t have the sugar spike and calories but only the good stuff occasionally try working out without an energy drink and listening to an audiobook for example or not listening to anything if you still need caffeine to kickstart your workout then buy mg caffeine pills and pop one or two min before a workout basically vary all of the good feel things you do that associate with workouts   \n","412
