 and already curious about this kind of things
 my life at age is improving almost every day since i found andrew huberman his teaching is so exciting amp so very well delivered i appreciate him so much

 year old engineering student from nepal checking in

 this would have been excellent and time we ll spent if the actual technique was given in detail on how to attach a dopamine release to an activity for the lack oof this i formation i fi d this video tiring
 true
 you have muslims next to you with rules that encompass this and so much more surprised youre surprised at this content
 oh wow you are an engineer student thats so cool
 this is my first super chat the amount of depth and knowledge about dopamine is just insane during covid era i have been struggling with depression and had many suicidal thoughts its been three years still i couldn t achieve a state of calmness thanks to quora i found out you i am still a high school student hope these podcasts never stop love from india
 your life will get betterlife is full of lessons keep on trucking
 sending u virtual hugs
 i am a phd student from germany first i want to say thanks for all the efforts you made for the podcast i know it is one thing to understand scientific research results it is another thing to explain in a easy way to people not in this field but andrew nailed i can easily understand all the contents he said and i really like how he put everything in a smooth logic flow this podcast is a masterpiece i feel so lucky that i find this podcast
 so if sex increases dopamine x over the baseline and smoking x does it mean that smoking during sex increases x and what about if you also eat chocolate at the same time would be interesting to study such combination as part of phd research
 i wanted to leave a very important message here to myself i had given up from trying to quit my addiction after failing for years of thinking and working and trying everything i could to stop i can t even say what it is because i am embarrassed years later and hours of a legendary podcast i today on th of june saturday pm i have managed to control my brain for an entire week with nothing but willpower and i feel i can never fail i will continue to update andrew thank you for blessing our lives with your knowledge

 how is it going what strategy worked for you
 how is it going bro keep on putting a fight
 i just cleared the thoughts whenever i would get even the slightest desire i would be like to myself remember how low it feels after and how long that low stays yea i prefer this unlimited long lasting high and just allways do stuff dont be sitting home doing nothing go out run work create something allways do so much that you feel ready to pass out and then just go sleep and do it again tomorrow this is a shortcut towards becoming a legend i am sorry but from me there will be no more updates i will be focusing on creating an online business and currently learning more about more fields good luck all
 quot nothing but willpower quot is setting yourself for fail you need strats you don t just for example sit in front of a chocolate cake to try how hard you can resist it with sheer will you just don t buy the cake
 meltygear but when you think about that cake it takes will power to stop thinking or control your thoughts
 keep it up bro
 thank you so much br you are literally saved my life and existence br i was struggling with adhd whole my life and fortunately to youtube algorithms i find your channel where i can explore the ways how to improve the quality of my life thank you so much andrew absolutely amazing work
 i ve hurt myself and others by not knowing these things it s borderline criminal not to teach this stuff at school show a teenager this one video and their entire life could be different
 the entire system is designed to get people addicted to things they think they need that they don t why would they teach you to be able to think for yourself and all that that s less profitable
 yea its literally a crime to not teach these at school im still a yo student and i found my self doing stupid mistakes in every aspect of my life
 mahertoujani luckily you realized it early on
 i have kids yrs and under i plan to start now in ways they can understand
 mahertoujani same brother i m also yo student who has realised his prior mistakes and making changes in life
 i believe that the scientific lingo in this podcast would put most teenagers into a coma
 exactly man
 they wont teach it because the system wants you depleted easier to control
 same
 totally agree as a year old recently diagnosed with adhd understanding my brain and how dopamine works has been extremely helpful to understanding to how my brain works and developing ways to cope and function somewhat normally
 djjayem you re absolutely right we ve already had ex social media execs admitting it s designed to encourage compulsive use
 so true its criminal not to teach kids about mental health at all in school we could prevent suicide improve the overall quality of life save those kids thousands of in mental health bills in the future instead school focuses on teaching some stuff that wont matter at all to of ppl in the future
 some people never even had a chance to realize it consider yourself lucky to be in todays internet age
 i got introduced to andrew hubermans work by my older sister when i was im now and am so thankful for his lectures especially due to the stage of youth extreme growth that i am at his work is absolutely incredible and i find myself getting so much more knowledge and by extension wisdom through my application of the knowledge in my life thank god for my older sister andrew huberman and his lab
 richardkrug he defines everything in the beginning most kids are smarter than they get credit for
 keep in mind that our understanding of these systems is still growing and evolving before we can teach something its has to be widely taught and understood the next generation will be greatly aided by what were learning today heck my parents still remember lead paint
 its has become essential since the dominance of the attentioneconomy hope education gets updates faster
 most teenagers arent gonna sit through with full attention paid an almost hour long video while sitting in a classroom
 i did learn this in high school most people just don t give a fuck about what the teacher is saying i still learned a lot more from this video though
 much of this material is taught in ap psychology which you can take at many high schools i agree that the way huberman presents it is more comprehensive though a big issue is lack of student interest in these topics i e you can lead someone to water but you can t force them to drink many teens and early s feel invincible and uninterested in learning about this until they begin to experience significant discomfort suffering in life the saying quot youth is wasted on the young quot exists for a reason
 benalexander social media execs dont run schools
 djjayem they the government benefits if youre a hard worker
 slide i m not talking about governments they are just puppets for the elites young males are a threat as they are capable of revolution keep them distracted and the threat is lowered
 public school isn t there to help the people that attend
 i start nofap br today january br i hope this year i will not be relapsed br i believed myself
 absolutely unfortunately important practical usefull things like critical thinking skills money management and physical and mental health are not taught to kids in high school the teaching should be relevant to your life and address important issues that are destroying and eroding our culture and our future br this is what happens when education or most anything is under the control of government
 i wish my biology lessons at school were this interesting
 its very intentional that the school system doesnt teach any life skills to keep the classes to keep rich rich and the poor poor the rich know better and teach their kids better bc of experience
 they do you just need a loan for k to go to college
 my school taught some of this actually
 postautonomy good luck with that
 watched this with my cousin today and that was the most common thing we kept saying wish we knew this in our teens could have saved us from a lot of damage better late than never
 shit like this goes against the agenda the people in control dont want us to be educated
 dpend what high schools br br i have only seen these psychology courses starting at community college
 majicreiki thats wonderful my first video that i viewed was his using failures movement amp balance to learn faster however i do believe any of his earlier stuff would be great it would help in easing an individual into his podcasts any topics that have to do with emotion sleep or focus would be good when i first watched huberman i chose videos that targeted topics that i was having a tough time in my life with
 follow islam and teach it to your kids it has way more benefits than the current understanding of dopamine
 hozyaka honestly it brings me a certain kind of joy seeing someone as young as you are applying yourself to this kind of knowledge and discipline when i was your age i was so addicted to video gaming i let go of every other aspect of life to have such knowledge at your age is immensely important to your success hold onto these things in your heart never let them go
 jixpuzzle same here man hope youre doing well knowledge is power
 well said
 it s borderline criminal in my mind that we have government schools at all they re atrocious abusive indoctrinating and don t teach a lot of things like financial literacy i agree this should be taught
 richardkrug get off the high horse richard you are talking as if science isn t a subject in school
 does anyone know what specific brand product to purchase that is pure pea per andrews suggestion i went to thorne supplements to find it but i may have missed it also looking for a clean reputable brand for alpha gpc too thank you in advance for your help
 djjayem unfortunately yes the people in control wants to keep us sedated the whole entertainment industry movies video games porn drugs etc the youth have no chance it is a dopamine prison
 literally took the words out of my head well said i m going to tell this to and show this video too as many people as i can
 rationalistfaith did you know that at one point islamic countries led the world in scientific advancement now unfortunately they do not
 the world is about discovery one of the big problems that i noticed in person and online people blame others for their own problems and shortcomings
 inshallasiuuu ya akhi in my high school only one science class was required in junior high school two science classes were required they were all so boring i could barely stay awake my add and hypoglycemia didn t help either if dr huberman had been instructing i m sure he would have held my attention i m now and just beginning to be interested in science i do wish though that i had known this back then mae alsalama
 welp im hella lucky then nice
 mahertoujani im in the same exact situation
 a year old teenager saw it
 absolutely true
 yeaa but sadly these schools teach all kids the same useless bs
 i would say even sooner than that to teach it quot school quot is an indoctrination station factory worker styled system of corrupt government man made religion debunked material atheism dogma and non vegan toxicity
 i agree we should start a petition to the united states department of education
 we should definitely educate them so nobody get hurt i included
 nickb very true us old folks need to help them understand things in a way they will listen it s always the teacher not the student
 majicreikimaybe start with social posts and shorts once you find a topic that peaks your interest find longer more in depth videos this may cause your brain to become excited to sit through longer presentations i download his videos to watch bit by bit when i m stuck somewhere without internet access
 mahertoujani it s not quot literally a crime quot you might say that s actually the problem because there s no methodology to hold shapers of youthful minds accountable

 it would have to be majorly dumbed down way too much jargon amongst the actual useful nuggets
 lukeleeblocklennis unless they want change then they force to listen but i agree most won t
 thats all religion has ever been is a way of regulating dopamine dopamine addiction really does create massive sin

 i am the teenager watching this hoping her life will be changed
 school gives only material knowledge main purpose of our education system is how to student get earn money by doing any job education is now buisness it don t teaches how to deal with stress anxiety depression such kind of issues we are not taught all this thing in school but actually it s all going wrong meditation is necessary to everyone how to control anger fearness etc
 borderline criminal lol
 they dont teach kids anything they need for their future its so horrible
 mahertoujani well you gotta keep in mind profits are made through the drugging of people taking advantage of their dopamine in modern day society so tbh im concerned for hubermans safety for opening pandoras box to give mankind their self control and full self empowerment back
 dpend i cab assure you that of the viewers are on their adulthood and probably around their s s knowledge acceptance only comes with maturity even then few are ready to transcend into a new level of awareness
 lukeleeblocklennis the e
 wish i saw this in high school life wouldve been different for sure
 mahertoujani
 they didn t know these things when i went to school
 i belive thats still time for you t turn around bro and turn your past suffering into knowled and motivation

 completely agree with you i work at a mental health facility for teenagers and will employ info from this video for our next group session
 if they teach this sort of stuff at school they wouldn t make a generation of zombies

 so true
 aa
 so true
 how you hurting others by just lack of kniwledge even if you did not know how you hurting them and yourself its not like you given meth or in th case taken it yourself which only person you hurt it just yourself at that point at most
 they wont teach you this because they dont want you to feel good they want you weak and easy to control
 rationalistfaith can you explain that so we can understand
 but pronouns are more important
 fully agree




 i m over what can i do
 richardkrug br
 jixpuzzle
 yes but children must learn chemistry and the story of romeo and juliet
 djjayem system doesnt want you depleted system wants you productive so you can make money buy stuff contribute to wealth stop drinking the conspiracy theorists cool aid
 so true i guess it would be much more valuable than opening up frogs
 dude for real
 lets not forget the responsibility our parents had couldve had

 they dont want everyone to knowit would ruin the rat race

while getting replies richardkrug youve got two comments above that are evidence against your comment
while getting replies djjayem yes beyond that all of our schooling was to make us effective thoughtless workers who wont rise up against the ruling class
while getting replies hozyakaget it kid keep it up youre going to be something awesome
while getting replies lukeleeblocklennisim an adult and i watched this in sessions kids would love to spend class periods over a week or two watching this

while getting replies be careful you dont get sucked into believing everything is part of a conspiracy you are responsible for your own critical thinking
while getting replies bro good talk
while getting replies absolutely so true
while getting replies what you don t understand is the people who structured the school system and curriculum know this knowledge and indepth they structured the school system to go against and attack the natural creatures they cut off a little here a nip and tuck there to make you fit into this box as a dumbed down and compliant slave the school system is more criminal than you can imagine they break you down on a biological neurological and psychological level to fit you into that box remember in school when you got floride tabs or rinses how about you parents being convinced you needed adhd medication keep seeking truth just realize most cannot handle the truth
while getting replies i have been saying the same thing br everything we use we learned in the first years of school the last years should be about things like this and the power of our words and other universal laws that will actually help us
while getting replies muhammadabdullah hn fpdid you

while getting replies i agree i have add i m very smart and a skilled electrician and mechanic i ve struggled my whole life with add and the behaviors and issues associated with it luckily the last year i ve finally started managing it better so that i can be successful in life i m very interested in solutions that do not involve taking drugs to manage symptoms of add and do involve treating the root cause of add ex naturally balancing dopamine levels meditation exercise etc
while getting replies ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppode vir aqui no oa
while getting replies yes my friend glad you made it this far
 thank you so much i am years old in college and am learning so much valuable information from your podcast your podcast really has really helped shape me into a more healthy person i know you have separate videos covering the subject of marijuana however i cant help but point out it would be really interesting if you made a video talking about marijuana and its direct relation and effect to our dopamine and epinephrine levels thank you again

 he did it
 i generally don t comment on any videos but i have to say that this work by andrew huberman is pure gold it gave me a fresh perspective towards my life and the things that are going on moreover this video came at a time when i was not miserable but kind of not able to figure out what i enjoy doing what i really wanted and i am in a downward spiral in my life because i don t find anything meaningful or just feel purposeless most of the time i do understand that i am spiking my dopamine right now saying all this but i would definitely implement whatever is being advised here and see what works for me it s like controlling the very processes that lead to how we feel what we do ultimately shaping our lives and if such a thing can be done for the betterment of us then why not
 how is the process going you feel better
 thank you dr huberman for making this info available for free online and for the clear and detailed breakdown learned so much and already applying it in my life
 as a former video game addict i thank you for this video i ve been wondering why i m so unmotivated and this explains a lot
 thank you so much sir for this amount of knowledge for free one podcast has taught more than what i ve learned in years you re great

 thankyou
 seems way too difficult to maintain motivation follow through and do what you need to do to live our best life even a decent life
 so is this depression
 thanks man now i m happier than before that i m muslim br thanks god br this podcast will change my life like what i expected
 thank you so much dr huberman i have adored your podcasts most content these days is built upon false narratives and are largely people s opinions over fact thank you for being a tool for equalizing access to education as someone who left school years ago and didn t follow the path of academia i am so so grateful that i can still learn and expand my mind through your podcasts thank you keep doing what you do
 hey andrew you know i feel that my baseline of dopamine is increases in work after watching this podcast thanks for this deep detailed podcast today i learned alot which i haven t knew before thanks
 thank you i m a professional artist who s been fascinated by neuroscience for a long time over a decade i ve done a few series based on brain structures and experiences so thanks again for having this podcast i wish i had time to transcribe it for notes amp finding diagrams for my collage series on pharmaceuticals addictions and sobriety but it s ok i ll figure it out wish we could have a coffee and chat about doing art science project since i m in woodside near stamford but don t know how it would begin or where it could be shown anyways thanks for the dope dopamine podcast
 this gave me so much insight on the biology and reasons for my lows i quit smoking weed months ago because i wanted to become a better version of myself i keep trying to compare experiences to that high it results in me not enjoying other activities so now that i have this understanding i can better navigate my life and become more happier and motivated thank you
 thanks absolutely mind blowing i haven t finished this lecture but i literally feel goosebumps and tears hearing those knowledges i will strive to be a better person by using all of that valuable knowledges
 bro that s awesome
 did he donate it k amazing man
 pedalesmexicali it s indonesian rupee something dollar
 pedalesmexicali indonesian rupees
 pedalesmexicali no that person donated usd after the conversion from idr it s still great that that person is supporting the podcast
 noo guys idr is indonesia currency idr is equal to us dollar
 your content is a game changer upon being prompted for a donation request i gladly sent the maximum amount no questions asked i wish you more success andrew the human race needs what you have to offer
 thank you for your interest in science best wishes andrew
 ah the old dopamine hit
 hubermanlab money talks
 congratulations you just donated money to someone wealthier than you bravo
 hyenaxs this way he showed his gratitude for the lesson he had received what s wrong with you none of your money none of your business
 yooanto gotta thank the patrons
 hyenaxs fr he could have said quot thanks to you im going to donate dollars to a home that cares for those with alzheimers etc instead he donated to a millionaire who hosts guests such as athlean x who misrepresent the science
 caliconnexion do you know exactly if he did not any donations to the list you mentioned get lost
 caliconnexion genuine question what has jeff done wrong
 caliconnexion davie before you judge when in life have you done something like that
 hyenaxs congratulations to you after years you have one subscriber
 ignore these naysayers it s great that you donated to someone who s creating such valuable content i would if i could too
 caliconnexion the money goes to his lab at stanford and being able to make this type of content maybe hes wealthier because hes working
 glgl
 hyenaxs its an exchange of energy who cares
 abuse of dopamine triggers leads to being an unhappy cynic like barry
 in a world full of noise this video is the real deal for getting your life together the lessons hit deep and show you the way to become your best self it s not just advice it s a guide to dragging yourself out of the shadows and into your awesome potential dive in and let this be the start of your epic journey
 this video could not have found me at a better time in my life this is invaluable thank yo very much andrew
 thank you dr huberman for sharing your passion amp expertise on these subjects you are turning me into a neurobiology nerd and i love it subscribed
 dr huberman thank you for existing and wanting to help humanity br br i just discovered your channel and am extremely fascinated by all this helpful content you present you explain concepts in a very clear and interesting way also using recent studies from prestigious medical journals to present facts and ideas in non biased ways allowing us to utilize this information to improve our lives br br part of depression is not feeling any joy or motivation for anything even for things that we once found enjoyable because it s not engaging as it was before and there s a lack of meaning or purpose behind it especially for high achieving people always accomplishing at their highest level and there s always that underlying question of quot what s next quot br br part of it is needing extremely high levels of a certain substance drug activity in order to feel joy and excitement and if we can t feel that quot high quot anymore then what s the point of wasting our time and energy searching for these highs that never last and these lows that only continue to worsen br br br everyone experiences depression differently some might feel persistent sadness and guilt while others will feel baseline neutral to everything even if its something considered pleasurable like sex alcohol drugs eating your favorite food etc like you can literally get a high raise promotion and still feel quot meh quot about it
 andrew i can t thank you enough for this lecture and all your other content i ve watched a lot and seen you on the ymh podcasts too it s so selfless that you spend so much time making this content to just give to the masses i feel like i ve learned so much from this i have adhd and i ve been on quite the journey i didnt like being on the meds after a few years of it and have largely taught myself to keep it in check without being medicated but every couple of weeks i need to crash and have some down days as it s hard to hold that line for extended periods of time i now understand why and i now have some things to try to manage that i have now worked up the courage to watch your adhd lecture been avoiding it no idea why thanks again
 can you talk about dopamine and movement disorders
 practical summary br br dopamine management br abstain from or limit highly desirable activities for up to a month so the dopamine levels are replenished and the baseline dopamine release returns to normal br peaks of dopamine decrease our baseline dopamine required to general motivation and satisfaction with life br go for intermittent random releases of dopamine br don t bundle pleasurable activities with things you want to do gym and music br flip a coin and choose how much pleasure bundling you ll do to the next activity br otherwise the activity alone becomes less pleasurable br br direct practices br cold water exposure x increase and sustained for hours afterwards br peaks br chocolate x br sex x act and pursuit of it br nicotine x br cocaine x br amphetamine x br exercise x up to x the more you enjoy it subjectively br coffee combined with another activity coffee makes the dopamine release more effective br connection with other people br br mental strategies br subjectivity perception and belief br hearing something that validates our belief about an activity makes it more pleasurable br journaling thinking positively about something you remember or you re experiencing now releases dopamine br learn to spike dopamine from effort br don t spike dopamine prior to engaging in effort br don t spike dopamine after engaging in effort br learn to spike dopamine from effort itself
 so we should avoid dopamine peaks from chocolate cocaine nicotine etc but do cold water exposure and exercise instead right why they peak dopamine as well gt our dopamine tank gets depleted gt our dopamine baseline is on a lower level no i dont get it
 great synopsis
 otavio while your summary is accurate the good professor s content is minimally accurate br not one rather several of his conclusions are based on wholly inadequate controls one phat example is using gamers experience shallow achievement is a world apart from licit profit winning a video game has no relation to meritable achievement delivering longer lasting or broader benefits have clicked on quot free click charity quot buttons every day for about days and still feel such a thrill at the action every day every click saves a life never a decrease in baseline dopamine long list of other examples i admire prof huberman enormously and he speaks with charm and authority that doesn t elevate his accuracy level your note taking and your skills at summary are nearly exquisite what huge potential you show best of energy to the best of your efforts
 yac as far as i remember the thing about cold water exposure is that it increases the baseline and has a long lasting effect so its not like an immediate spike and consecutive plummeting but more of a gradual thing improving your mood and being you might also want to keep in mind that cold water exposure has other benefits that improve your overall well being and it cant be compared with most dopamine spiking activities furthermore cold water increases your adrenaline baseline first and its directly related to your dopamine levels but i forgot the exact mechanism d
 zholnerchuk i see cold water exposure is different thanks for the answer and the details mate cheers
 supercharging i have to disagree your gaming example actually supports what he said in the episode youre describing addictive dopamine habits where doing the activity will further increase the dependency on the habit
 don t bundle pleasurable activities together like running and having sex at the same time
 e
 nonsense your dopamine levels don t require weeks to replenish they can be replenished with a single good night s sleep if they couldn t you would be physically unable to stay conscious dopamine isn t merely something that your brain rewards itself with it s a critical neurotransmitter that about a third of your brain s neurons require to transmit signals at all
 sounds like what i do for days every year the fasting month of ramadan
 yac no not really thats not how it works the spike from cocaine will never be the same as an ice bath a spipke from an ice bath is more prolonged sustainable more natural more steady more balanced remember you you dont want spikes nor high nor low you want steadiness you want balance
 carlosbustosofficial thx for your comment cheers
 hafsahmahmood exactly
 nomerompanlaspelotas that would be interesting to try lol
 well done
 yac check out the
 where can i get more info like this to learn more

 yac because they are damaging practices while cold shocks have other benefits if your dopamine becomes reliant on cigarettes that means you have to smoke cigaretts to get dopamine
 thank you
 thank you this is useful
 ty man ur a king
 thank you for this
 thanks a buddy br br may lord gives you everything u wish
 abdulmuhaimintahseen how do you do that
 abdulmuhaimintahseen thanks so much i didn t know this before
 thanks for this
 who else went and had a cold shower bath after watching this video
 yac watch the whole video then later on watch it again then you will get it
 thanks very helpful
 thanks for the highlights thanks
 yac i think the answer is yes i am not yet entirely certain but my thoughts about the why are that if one is attempting the detox then the point of detoxing is to learn to control the release of one s own dopamine by being intentional about it i haven t yet done the exercise but hope to return after having made some headway to either confirm or be disappointed in my lack of understanding and failure
 supercharging you must not be a gamer therefore you can not know how serious gaming is to those who live in the world of gaming
 adinashaina thx for sharing your thoughts aldina
 nomerompanlaspelotas nooooooh i love horizonal jogging don t take it away from me
 after the awake
 dopamine management do have a carrot on a stick but never allow to consume it
 o so thats y im addicted to adderall
 basically he meant let s live a life as boring as possible
 society would be better if more people were like you
 man youre no fun nomerompanlaspelotas oh
 speedoneverything love love looove aderall
 hailongkhong yeah forget that
 ya c cold therapy also releases the catacholamines i e epinephrine and norepinephrine in conjunction with dopamine unlike those others these compounds work synergistically
 this would have been excellent and time we ll spent if the actual technique was given in detail on how to attach a dopamine release to an activity for the lack oof this i formation i fi d this video tiring
 if effort gives me dopamine shouldn t i skip doing it regularly
 thanks a lot
 yac dopamine will always go down it depends on the benefit you got from it going down you could take coke and it dopamine would plummet and youd have no benefits from that or you could lift weights and dopamine would slightly go down but youll have the benefits of weight training
 i read a book atomic habits where it s suggested to pair activities you love with activities you don t in order to make your goal pleasurable but this podcast is saying different now idk what to do lol
 supercharging yes winning a video game is just as significant in your brain as learning new skills as your example pointed out clicking has never saved a life ever or even led to improving anyone s life there is one exception it increases dopamine in delusional clickers it doesn t matter if it s meaningless objective reality isn t important to the brain believing jesus hears your prayers increases dopamine so does any pagan ritual you believe in
 the more you look at this the more you actually realise we are genetically hardwired for obedience to the bible this is amazing
 i tend to enjoy things like studying while i do them but getting myself to initiate study i find very difficult any advice
 when you miss a day of lecture tavin has your back thanks for letting us copy your notes a href about invalid zcsafez a
 yac someone else answered about the purported difference with cold water exposure but with regards to something like exercise what he was saying is that you want to avoid extraordinarily large dopamine peaks that will undermine your ability to benefit from normal dopamine peaks which you get from something like exercise if you enjoy exercise it is good to experience the normal dynamic variance of dopamine levels because that is what the system has evolved to do to benefit us but regularly using or indulging abnormal unnatural external sources of dopamine spiking will mess with your perception of other normal things in the short term and degrade your baseline and overall life satisfaction in the long term he also didn t say to totally abstain from chocolate either just be aware of how it affects your dopamine and enjoy it accordingly
 mittortz thanks for sharing appreciate your comment
 yac watch the whole video lmao this comment doesnt justify this masterpiece of a video

 yac es

 hafsahmahmood as we should brother br ramadan is close and we should take full advantage of that great month

 nomerompanlaspelotas yeah running trains
 replies to now haha xd
 thanks

 nomerompanlaspelotas i saw roller skating and sex in benidorm
 commenting to come bacn
 anyone who is serious about this topic should take the hours to listen to the whole episode
 thank you
 supercharging wrong
 wish this video could be summarized in layman s terms without context it isn t clear
 now we can learn to spike dopamine from the effort itself
 the sages of the ages have more to say about this they did not speak chemistry but what they have to say works
 thanks
 awesome
 thankyou
 thanks broooo
 minister peter v church no it s not that we re hardwired for obedience of bible it s just that the bible was written accordingly to human nature hence its millennia lasting popularity that s totally different you could even say the same about the vedas and many other religious texts as someone also mentioned the benefits of ramadan fast in this comment section and so on
 thank you for this
 he forgot to add something to the list for good reason its insulting another feeling the win in battle against your opponent social media is just one example where people get this from this is the motivator for all that toxic stuff you see people are getting high on it
 zholnerchukcan u state the source you read them i m a biotech student and i d like to study them too mate
 spartan same feeling yo mate let me know too if you get the answer
 neerajm not really mate it s like i heard it on a couple of podcasts including this one however as far as i m concerned dr humberman mentions all the links to the studies for each episode on his podcast site not sure but you can check this out
 yac exercise and cold exposure don t create the crash afterwards
 carlos bustos yes bc cocaine opioids actually permanently lower the amount of dopamine they create that is why they have to increase the amount they take it damages the receptors and it doesn t reverse
 great summary thank you
 minister peter v church perhaps the bibles recommendation like many religious practices were designed by the ruling powers to dominate and control its followers by a intuitive comprehension of how we react to restrictions permissions and rewards
 yac the cold water results had an arch vs a spike hope that helps i thought the same thing
 great
 god bless you

 boy we vets sure got this all wrong br but its nice to now know what is wrong
 what about people that are on adhd meds
 yac the drop is less dramatic cold water high last for like more then hours cocain it drops when it wears off our body reacts and doesnt wear off when we cool off warming up increases it too thats why you sometimes laugh when you get out of a cold shower and feel so good
 abdulmuhaimintahseen thank u
while getting replies ya c i m pretty sure it s bc chocolate and other substances are quick high spikes of dopeamine while exercising and cold showers last for longer have other health benefits
while getting replies thank you
while getting replies thank you

while getting replies bhagavad gita chapter verse br br br br meaning you have the right to work only but never to its fruits results br let not the fruits of action be your motive nor let your attachment be to inaction br you have the right to perform your actions but you are not entitled to the fruits of the actions br you should never be motivated by the results of your actions nor should there be any attachment in not doing your prescribed activity br br in video learn to spike dopamine from effort br don t spike dopamine prior to engaging in effort br don t spike dopamine after engaging in effort br learn to spike dopamine from effort itself br br similar
while getting replies bhagavad gita chapter verse that which in the beginning may be just like poison but at the end is just like nectar and which awakens one to self realization is said to be happiness
while getting replies thank you for the summary save my time
while getting replies yac we should avoid getting dopamine frequently from those things that will not help us become better and just get dopamine from those efforts like exercise now not reasult of exercise but its effort or studying or just walking because these things will help you in life but eating choclate or eating any fast food will not
while getting replies carlosbustosofficialyes thats correct
while getting replies thanks for your effort in summarizing very helpful for me
while getting replies thanks
while getting replies supercharginglook kry br o
while getting replies carlosbustosofficialcan having cold showers on daily basis give you a gradually slowly increasing dopamine level which is not to high and not to low right my doubt being if a person is addicted to br methamphetamine the same amount of meth substance will not satisfy him he needs more and more as his addiction journey goes on because the baseline is not normal it is extremely low so is this mechanism even true in the case of cold showers after certain period of time even we won t feel that much effect because we are now used to cold showers and now it s a normal thing to us
while getting replies and now i just hate the youtube app coders for blocking the option to copypaste comments br i need this saved it my notepad
while getting replies well said thank u for this
while getting replies nomerompanlaspelotas hahahah he said dont bundle a pleasurable activity with a mediocre activity but thats hilarious lol
while getting replies
while getting replies awesome thanks
while getting replies superchargingso the point is that we should be managing dopamine for a broader healthier life and not for a narrower unhealthy life where we are duped into negative and narrow dopamine schedules with negative and narrow beliefs and lifestyles a key difference between the two is when i subjectively and repeatedly experience effort and contribution to a wider longer time frame healthier life i will have a healthier dopamine schedule especially as i will then find myself wanting to get off any dopamine schedules that are producing a negative or narrow life plus some awareness of the effect of dopamine depletion can help in avoiding unhelpful thoughts and actions when bottoming out from dopamine depletion
while getting replies peace be upon u amp us wow thank you so much for this summary
while getting replies it all goes down to selfdiscipline and awareness people sleeping wanted distracted with multimedia and programmed scedule sad
while getting replies nature provided everything cold water in the face it s of years old technique to create a shock moment and to brain to function cold shower is they key not to get sick apple a day keeps the doctor aways camomile tea for sleep oldest herb in the book dates instead chocolate suggar is the addictive food we can eat more addictive the cocain kids can t even taste a natural food anymore suggar is in everything and keeps them overstimulated and malnutritioned to function adhd didn t exist years ago
while getting replies i was simply thinking about my smoking habit and remembered that it s a hit of dopamine and wanted to learn more this is so helpful i never knew the works of dopamine this will now help me thank you
while getting replies i m addicted to dopamine life long addiction that i never linked together until right now
while getting replies many thanks it took huberman over hours that s why i can t listen to this guy i don t have the patience
while getting replies i mean i think i d rather live life and feel alive and not be as productive and successful and perfect as he and others like tim ferris are what s the point i get it tho i have bipolar which is sort of an involuntary massive spike in dopamine followed by a major crash it sucks but i also have two degrees from usc and can earn a living if i want men are really into hyper optimizing themselves i m a chick but to me it s a bit myopic devolved my time with monks in thailand is just meditate and don t think so hard and don t resist and choose the middle way the more you edit your life like counting every calorie and nanonutrient the more asleep for it you ll be cheers

while getting replies stauber my preworkout
while getting replies thank you so much
while getting replies thank you sir
while getting replies jaimyxsnsd i think pairing a difficult activity with something pleasurable may initially be a good strategy if you lack the motivation to do it but as huberman says you need to teach yourself to find pleasure from the effort even if it may mean lying to yourself a little your mind and brain is more malleable than we think that is what i took from this episode we just need to understand the rules so in the beginning you may need to use something pleasurable to motivate the hard task but overtime you will need to taper it down to be less dependent on it as you develop the habit hope that made sense
while getting replies that is too simplistic you need to listen to the details of what he is saying
while getting replies excellent
while getting replies
while getting replies thanks
while getting replies er
while getting replies f
while getting replies ft
while getting replies mind boggling
while getting replies i m still confused about how the system works you can be the most well rounded and healthy individual but if you do something like playing a video game for an hour a day after work or reading a book or anything else that you enjoy you re decreasing your baseline because said activity is being done every day there are so many things in life that quot spike quot your dopamine so i just can t see a schedule that would work for most people are you supposed to like randomly pick days of the week where you try to make yourself as miserable as possible by say only working and sleeping and not do anything quot fun quot
while getting replies abstaining from dopamine woudl kill me either me or someone near me d
while getting replies no you should do cocaine and chocolate while smoking in cold shower yac
while getting replies you re great thnx for sharing
 thank you so much this podcast has changed my life br i am a fifty five year old woman who has been struggling with parkinson s for over four years even though i ve read and studied everything available on the subject nothing has been as helpful as your podcast br i live in france and would love to see your work translated into french so i can share it br god bless you and your work
 wow such a great lecture thank you andrew for this insightful episode i definitely understand now much more when it comes to this brain neuromodulator and i was also able to identified what i ve been doing wrong recently layering other sources of dopamine on top of each others and waiting for the end reward eye opening video
 thank you for the abundance of knowledge and support br br something that i would really enjoy diving deeper into is impulsivity why people with adhd are so impulse prone and how can we manage life without self sabotage br br thanks again
 what an astonishing job andrew having relied on motivation before taking on challenges throughout my entire life i now realize that i can proactively enhance my quality of life by applying science backed protocols from your videos this further reinforces my strong belief in science i couldn t be more grateful for your work
 this is really dope i gained a lot of explanation for life and what and how to improve to make better decisions blessed to have came across your work
 actions you can take from this lecture br avoid dopamine layering with challenging activity br entertainment music smartphone etc substance and social stimulants br derive dopamine from effort itself not the reward after br try cold exposure therapy and or intermittent fasting br avoid dopamine spiking drugs sugar and pornography
 that s correct and one needs to be a total moron to not get it without all of this neuroscientist crap
 thanks
 oh porn and sugar hard my friend hard to let it go
 married texan makes perfect sense for those who watched the podcast br the trick is in doing self affirmations i e you affirm yourself that you really need to do that work and or you really enjoy that and of course in order for that to work you should have some strong reasoning for why is it important for you and what real benefits you may get out of completing this work
 avoid porn is funny as hell
 mrbarosxp why is it funny
 mrbarosxp maybe for immature people
 mrbarosxp what s funny is thinking it s good for you it ruined my moods and thinking once i was able to stop looking because of years of struggles with it i felt so much better
 scottmarshall for years i kind of shrugged it off as a problem only other people had after a long time struggling to even go a day or two clean its evident its a real problem
 married texan u are soo wrong
 eeeeeeeeeee
 seek out the effort with the desired result in mind without trying to be author of the results
 married texan how about runners high
 scottmarshall how did you quit how long did it take its like heroin
 thank you for this
 thanks man
 mrbarosxp coomer
 professor andrew watching you and listening to you is highly addictive and brings up my dopamine that was really enjoyable and comprehensive
 i cannot believe this is a free resource your ability to teach and pass along information is the best ive ever seen i cant thank you enough for all that you do andrew
 once more thanks so much for the quality info you re providing i feel that for the first time really in my life i have been given an explanation on why i feel the way i do about seeking pursuing goals in the outside world
 i can listen to him forever as a teacher i found a lot of useful information completely clear and precise capturing important nuances as much as possible considering how complex and multifaceted neuroscience is helps to systematize existing knowledge and this sweat voice makes it more enjoyable
 this is my first time listening to your pod cast and i completely love it i can t wait to listen to your other pod casts
 why is this info not taught to all of us at a school university level it is beyond my comprehension br great work dr huberman lots of love from india
 the country that teaches u piss and dung cures cancer will they teach you
 deffo
 why what do yo think the purpose of schooling is an intelligent population
 they need them worker ants brother
 vatanc you are also worker ant
 i agree but technically it is indirectly taught in relgion spirtuality br e g meditaiton visualisaiton meditation in buddhism will stabilise your dopamine baselines and help control the mind etc br though they didn t know the molecular neuroscience the practices still work
 if you wanted to exploit and control people would you make them proactive intelligent wolves or unintelligent distracted docile sheep
 because schools are not what you think they are designed to condition you to be a good working slave
 schools are focusing on brain washing our children with liberal race theory
 because the ones in charge of making our criteria for education don t know about it
 this is taught neuro physio biochemistry in the first two years of medical school
 cos they need you to work in a scam call centre or ola driver
 its upto us to bring it into schools if not directly with students theres a possibility in teacher preparation courses in india
 it gives the herd too much power
 university professors dont want really student to learn or they could challenge them br italian university s books are written using difficult words and concepts on purpose for that its always about power and control dinamics
 schools are gearing up in some sense because the cognitive brain research is flowing into teacher education as an essential course to understand how children learn and it addresses the key component of creating an environment of relaxed alertness
 why do you think they dont want us to know
 because school is controlled by the government government is incompetent and malevolent
 because we were not ready for it
 because it goes against the agenda of keeping an individual dependent upon external solutions
 svono svono music its very well mentioned in vedic scriptures years ago which is none other than science we are just unfortunate due to article that hindu s can t teach their treasure to their upcoming generation
 mattgibson you nailed it
 yeah
 svono svono music which is precisely why we re all seen a sharp decline in religious belief over the decades its runs counter to what is intended for all of us
 stevenrogersfineart oh they know they absolutely know
 quot why is this info not taught to all of us at a school university level quot br br why don t we all have a jet plane at home
 bbcrahmin quota people
 stefania mirri it s cuz they copied from somewhere else
 because this should be taught at home by your parents
 bcz math is more important
 they need people to consume these
 because schooling system is to create work force for different fields not to better your life in general
 the pharmaceutical world is the entity to question about why we all do not get the proper education about how our bodies really work this is my opinion from my life experiences which include a traffic accident brain trauma a seizure a hypothyroidism diagnosis and personal traumas such as losing my dad to the heart attacks while away from him losing a good friend to the traffic accident being a victim of an id thief being exposed to two different peoples verbal abuses at the same time period unknowingly getting financially tricked by first a hand relative etc thank you very much for your time dr andrew huberman
 school doesnt teach school is giving jobs
 do you think school teach something useful
 not all of these ideas are scientifically mature yet some things being discussed here are backed by only a couple of studies doesn t mean they re wrong but it likely means they re still likely to undergo major revisions high schools don t teach much science that goes beyond the consensus of the day as the teachers are not usually equipped to convey scientific uncertainty in a measured way that teenagers can understand
 it is not taught in schools because it is bro pseudoscience and a completely wrong take on the dopamine system how this guy teaches in stanford is beyond me
 schooling college education only focus on theory not practical things that harsh reality of education system
 u ochka wow so edgy of you
 crweaventure his delivery on an epically complex topic is a touch glib though don t you think most scientists don t choose such a complacent way to frame ideas that have barely advanced beyond conjecture in terms of scientific validation
 which wouldn t be a problem except for all the fanboys who take this guy s words as gospel because they don t understand how science works
 kitten processing inc isnt that the whole point i think we are all aware of how complex the brain is so having someone dumb down the concepts in a way that an average person can grasp it is where the value is now if youre telling me hes just lying about stuff thats a seperate argument but if hes willingly putting in the effort to make this complex topic somewhat digestible for an average viewer i see nothing but good things in that
 crweaventure i take your point i think this kind of work is a balancing act between being accessible and being misleading there s a sweet spot and he s not too far off it but you can see from the comments in this thread how many people want this guy to be a guru that s the risk and he could arguably do a bit more to address the problem a few caveats thrown in wouldn t hurt accessibility one bit
 kitten processing inc if you are going to condemn someone s teaching you better be prepared to expound on your own opinion and what qualifies your opinion or risk looking like a narcissistic idiot if you have true understanding why then create you own channel and enlighten us instead of name calling and taking cheap shots in a comment venue quot if you can t beat them you can always call them vile names quot
 anvilangst are you ok i only see one person calling names here
 chirotheca yes thats the goal and some do better than others
 b ackmagic br everybody needs to stop with the conspiracy because there is no conspiracy if you went to college and youve had the opportunity to take classes like this and if you didnt that was your fault this information has been out there forever but mr huberman puts it all together in a way that you can understand how it intertwines and works
 your the best much appreciated for explaining us for hours to watch something for hours feels like its too long but with patience you explained us for hours thank you
 greetings from cork ireland you are really inspiring and i enjoyed your questions and answers on your live on instagram earlier it was early hours of this morning in ireland saw more of your personality which was nice to see keep doing what you re doing
 this is one of the most incredible talks i have ever heard just fantastic thank you for your clear explanations i was hoping it would never finish it certainly gave me i would say a healthy dopamine rise xx
 i never comment on videos this podcast made me realize that i have no balance and helped me understand the steps on how to improve my dopamine threshold and how to maintain it this is very important thank you for sharing this knowledge and look forward to tuning in on more of your podcast
 you deserve a billion subscribers sir thank you so much for providing this knowledge for free
 this is the best podcast on the internet seriously i can barely believe we re getting this for free i can t say enough how much i ve managed to change my health and my entire life through this podcast alone i particularly loved the bit on caffeine i was terribly unsure about caffeine in my life now i m free to take it without stress the coin flip tool to remove predictability is quite amazing as well
 hey may i ask what are a few other golden pieces of practical youve acquired along the way br im working my way through his content but im curious
 max so true literally the best one comedy podcasts and sexual drama podcasts really do detrimental harm to the mind whereas this one serves to spiral everyone who listens upwards so they can chase their best self love it
 danyj yeah it s quite astounding makes you feel like dr huberman contributed to the advancement of the human species
 i can t believe it is for free either
 i agree its apparent hes not full of shit o imo huberman essentially provides you with the science based info that all the self help and wellness crowd tries to convey but might not fully understand he can snuff out bs studies that others might use in their books or way of thinking
 what coin flip tool what did i miss
 alexanderwindh i think it was about picking only one activity that boosts dopamine vs stacking respective activities
 phamawa so lets say youre working out one activity and really want to listen to music flip a coin if its heads listen to the music if its tails no music for you today in other words taker out the predictability or certainty out of it hope that helps
 karindetrick thank you nice succinct explanation
 forever grateful for youtube tho irritated by its politics mostly grateful
 such a marvelous podcast i thank you for giving us the opportunity to learn from you
 i love your podcasts they give me motivation to do something better with my life
 thanks so much professor andrew for your efforts and the knowledge you are sharing this is really enlighting br we love drinking from your firehose with an attempt to have better understanding
 what a wonderful source of knowledge for those who want to improve their health and overall well being many many thanks for your work
 i respect every single word you share on topics you want to speak about it s truly expiring watching you speak about these things but remember one thing please it s very easy to talk about what you need to do to improve things in life when you don t have a mental illness there are people out there with illnesses schizophrenia bipolar adhd autism so it makes it considerably more challenging to focus and being motivated so stops us being able to do things that others with no mental health condition can do our dopamine levels are affected because of the conditions and it is the wrong answer but it is why people end up addicted to drugs and sleeping with so many people because they chase an easier way of getting dopamine guess we all have a different way of dealing with it but the drive is showing people how to stay driven to the right way i deal with dopamine by going to the gym caring for my friends cooking for my friends educating myself going boxing and trying to be intellectual it all works for me we all need a method in order to help us cope i just think it s very important to understand that not everyone has the capacity to understand how to control dopamine and to be driven i wish that people that did know how to control dopamine would help people with mental illnesses more i wish that they could help more to understand these crucial things instead of putting individuals on medication that s not always the answer the answer is helping people understand things that will benefit our life and help implement the right things keep up the videos i highly appreciate
 confession i am addicted to huberman lab podcast entirely related to dopamine br br this particular episode is so relevant as my year old recovers from a dopamine roller coaster following her birthday next year im sticking her in an ice bath after the party
 my year old gets her daily dopamine from planning her birthday over and over again i know the day after the birthday party there will be a massive crash it never fails
 lol
 this was super funny
 same after following dr huberman s podcasted advice from the beginning i now feel like a year old
 same does anyone have any other podcast like huberman ive watched all his stuff just wish there were more people to watch knowledge well explained topics and credit sources like huberman does
 good this is why people who are and are still proclaiming quot it s my birthday month quot

 the ice bath can be good for people that have hangovers
 haha this reminds of the times when i would go to a sleepover as a kid and when you get back home you feel like your life sucks
 aspenwagon my yrs old coworker claims his birthday to be every month now i know why
 so many things make so much sense now don t they
 marthahorton nnn b
 hahahahahahaha mother of the year award
 too much coke
 bmr ben greenfield podcast he has everything to do with health youll love him
 holywoof thank you
 omg idk how u hit two homeruns with one at bat but you just did
 i feel like this the first week of january every year there s always a comedown after the week celebrating christmas and new years
 br not for me my bdays
 i m addicted to youtube video watching on my fucking phone as well as commenting on videos its a big time waster
 bmr i like lex friedman s podcast too tech philosophy stuff
 irismendonca thanks ill check him out
 bmr today i found out there s an ep here where andrew interviews lex that would be a good intro
 lol
 the cool thing no pun intended is that you will also release dopamine by social bonding with her it s a win win situation
 fieldboy maybe ur just tryna stay connected to humanity now that families are separated nd society is polarized this is the new norm ehh wonder what future generations will say about us lol
 lmao as a father of four i found this hilarious
 lol but sounds like a good thing would help
 the amount of dopamine i get from watching your videos is hopefully intermittent great content i watch passively or actively i always learn something or you solid concepts i learned once again from you
 i dont usually write many comments under videos but this is some outstanding material i have phd in chemistry organic not biochemistry but i always like to extend the horizons of my knowledge i have always been interested in how the amazing human body works and in brain chemistry particularly the more i know the more questions i have and your videos feed the apetite for learning new facts i want to say that as a smoker and an adhd person your insight on dopamine help me tremendously with how to cope and cut the vicious cycle into a line leading to positive goal to overcome the addiction and symptoms to have a better life i hope you know how great person you are for giving your time and energy to share important scientific information to general public for free thank you sir p s you should add listening to your videos on the list of dopamine releasing activities
 this all makes so so much sense i just wonder i always thought of myself as someone who can derive a lot of joy from many things such as studying and exercising now i definitely dont want this new knowledge to effect my perception of pleasure from these things as in expected to enjoy them less subconsciously and therefore do i will try to really pay attantion to how things make me feel more but i wanted to ask the community how have people found the balance between making things enjoyable because you want to do them for fun eg running with a good playlist vs implementing these strategies
 hi andrew i recently found your work loving it keep up the good work
 i love this podcasts it s very informative and their are several tools to maintain our dopamine level so which we can go ahead to chase our goals thankyou sir for giving such a informative podcasts
 i m a recovering meth addict months sober today thank you doctor huberman for giving me the tools necessary to get my quot happy quot back your videos on addiction and dopamine have delivered the skills i desperately sought to remain an inspiration to those i deeply care for who still suffer from addiction and who were too scared to take the initial steps necessary to a longer healthier and happier future seeing how much happier i am and how fast my life is blossoming at after doing meth since i was is blowing minds and helping people i know who had given up rethink they re potential your amazing and i want to thank you for changing peoples lives in such a noble infectious way sir you are a blessing thank you for saving my life

 kowikowi thank you for the kind response i used to be a heroin addict years and years ago and i checked myself into rehab i was starting to get bad detox shakes etc and i saw the doctor with a sigh of relief i thought thank god i can finally get something to help me with these dt s a few feet away there was an alcoholic who had also seen the doctor almost immediately they were pouring a heaping mound of different pills in his hand to help him with his detox and the doctor came over to me and told me i couldn t have any first i was shocked then i was terrified and i pleaded with him and pointed to the alcoholic next to me and said how come he gets all kinds of pills the doctor responded quot you feel like you re going to die but he s an alcoholic he might die without those pills quot i can t tell you how bad i felt at that moment my conscience took over my fear of sobriety without help from medication i felt like such an a hole then it occurred to me how the substance that s legal happened to be just as deadly if not worse than heroin can you believe it it was definitely an eye opener for me thank you again for the kind words all of you are an inspiration to my sobriety happy new year
 motomowi say that from some experience i was addicted to pain killers half my life did meth off and on it was extremely seductive in my opinion yeah it s definitely evil
 onerider oh and happy new year
 well done keep it up i can t imagine how difficult its been to kick your addiction and keep it at bay i kicked my marijuana addiction about months ago and that has been hard enough for me so i once again can t imagine something like meth you have my utmost respect
 tattwamasishwetketu have a read of dopamine nation andrew mentions it great book about addiction and ways to deal with it
 ericwilliams awesome thank you for the advice and support ill definately look into that and maybe give it a try thank you so much
 romellazar thanks a ton romel will check that one
 keep going brother
 that is awesome you are loved
 l br br m

 onerider its a bot lol check the channel
 deklenjones its a fake account and u fell for it lol
 kowikowi alcohol and benzos are actually the most dangerous drugs to quit acutely in fact its illegal to not taper people off br br ever since i quit drinking ive hated alcohol
 if youre looking for helpful chemicals to take while still remaining sober i have a few suggestions br br alpha gpc cognitive boost br br choline citicholine neuroprotective br br htp helps with serotonin production br br ashwaganda reduces effects of cortisol stress hormone reducing levels helps almost everything br br along with a battery of highly absorbable important formulations of magnesium b complex d and cod liver oil omega dha epa will really help throughout the day br br i cold turkeyed mg adderallxr and really went though it
 keep it up
 kowikowi glad you were able to quit drinking alcohol is the hardest drug there is only alcohol and benzo withdrawals kill people it s crazy that it s now proven that even drink a week significantly damages your health
 im proud of you keep it up

 i am coming off years on opiates and still trying to get my happy back congrats on your journey huberman is helping
 barbmoody oh hon i m so happy for you how long have you been without hubernan podcast taught me that caffeine helps you grow dopamine receptors back and jordan peterson talks about how important goals are dopamine is a a motivator right it drives you to achieve goals when you work toward a goal and crush it thats when dopamine drops happy on you like a sick bass beat keep setting goals kicking opiates is the biggest mountain honey the rest should be rolling hills in a sunny valley i m proud of you
 source i am not a bot thank you very much
 unbelievable
 lindboknifeandtool bet congradulations happy hear you get your happy back
 you go girl i m a medical doctor with some work experience from psychiatric wards i ve seen first hand how tough addiction can be on people s lives i m happy for you keep at it and remember you are worth it

 bonkb why does everyone keep replying man brother when the posters name is patricia
 bertington i have a friend who took it as a kid still struggles today she walked in on someone taking it and asked what it was they told her to try it and not to tell anyone wrecked her life for decades she is sober now but had fallen off the wagon a couple times in a year stretch
 i love how this explains a lot of the quot how quot behind mind science it really helped me to bridge the gap between spirit and biology
 thanks a ton mr huberman i can t imagine the amount of work that this fascinating eye opening video has required
 amazing summary loved the way it was structured and put forth in simple words for everyone to understand the best talk i have listened to in recent times
 thank you so much for this i am and need to balance my dopamine i learned a lot in this session
 tip for those who have just started watching this podcast and feeling overwhelmed with the information keep on going just stay till the end mind blowing things are about to come and also don t peak your dopamine levels before watching this video
 this was the most constructive and eye opening hours that i had in a long time
 wraios
 sevastos
 agreed
 so lovely to hear a scientist explaining molecular and cell biology in such a simple way i studied neuroscience at the university and loved it and miss it so much now i work in the cardiology great content youve got a new subscriber i came across you through one of the kelties video
 hy
 hello dr hurberman i ve suffered from depression and anxiety for years lots of ups and downs i have watched some of your cold water therapy been ff going cold showers twice a day i started with cool water eventually working into just cold showers i m slowly moving to cold baths i ve been working on other videos too you have helped me learn to even out my moods thank you so much
 thanks for this podcast i have parkinsons and this helped me to better understand the importance of dopamine and how it all comes together with that said i would appreciate any other podcasts relating to dopamine and pd
 this is gold you are explaining soo well thank you for this video
 thank you for your kind words
 hubermanlab thank you andrew for such a great content br regarding the last bits on influence of the microbiom br i heard many times that the gut microbiom produces substantial if not major amounts of dopamin and serotonin that s why the right food is so important br so you say it s rather an dopamine response to the food than neuromodulator production there br thank you once again
 years ago when i played football in order not to be touched i somehow convinced my brain if touched i will die i thought it was adrenaline but now i understand it was dopamine this is great information you explain it very well wow what an experience you had in the hospital your very lucky the doctors and nurses listened to your request they are usually too inflated with their achievement to even consider doing anything that over rides their authority thank you andrew i subscribed to your channel c

 that s what she said
 its as if the dragon pain is ready for a fight with me but its ok i am ready because i am the one who provoked it
 find meaning in suffering
 fantastic now i know why i am resilient
 you are amazing i am passing your channel info on to my doctor at university of michigan hospital thank you for your knowledge and inspiration
 locus of control is in my hands br br thank you for giving me information that helps to understand that and shows practical ways of experiencing that in everyday life br br with love from ukraine
 youre so incredibly informative and articulate thank you
 the huberman lab podcast has once again delivered an intriguing episode with quot controlling your dopamine for motivation focus amp satisfaction quot the title alone captures my attention as dopamine is a key neurotransmitter associated with various aspects of our behavior and emotions i m excited to explore how understanding and controlling dopamine can impact our motivation focus and overall sense of satisfaction the guest experts and insights presented in this episode promise to shed light on the intricate workings of our brain s reward system
 what makes me cringe is that this information is not taught in school i am years old and am only learning this absolutely mind blowing very well explained cheers andrew
 how many year olds would grasp these concepts
 antonismetallidis idk about years old but i wouldve loved to have gained some of this knowledge in high school
 he teaches in school in case you missed that
 tbh this is probably too much for the teachers
 this is graduate level neuroscience it is taught in grad school
 antonis metallidis possibly most if they were actually taught logic early and not in a state of shame like so many are at school if not at home and if the information was provided in ways that connect to the individual learners
 honestly most of this was not known when you were in primary school
 he teaches this in school i m years old and just learning this i think a lot of it is very new and there hasn t been enough time for schools to even know about
 jim cutsinger there has been evidence for things like mindfulness training for over twenty years yet it has not been utilised in any but the most progressive schools granted this is new information still education authorities around the world need to lift their game unfortunately i fear that teaching students to think critically is the last of their intentions if it exists at all go well
 dr nh oo totally agree youtube provides something different and important that schools cannot provide if you have the critical thinking to sort out value
 savioncohen no one listens in school stop it its the parents job
 the main methods of teaching are based on outcome br schools grades college teach through memorization and regurgitation of information for test taking br graduate school teaches critical thinking br colleges used to teach critical thinking skills but not any more at least in america br medical school especially has a focus on critical thinking the step test is the best example of this difference
 stuart hollingsead the outcomes of schooling grades through to college are underwhelming to put it nicely critical thinking needs to be foundational
 savioncohen i mean you wouldn t even properly know what hormones are in high school and if you were to write in this much detail about every useful hormone you ll have a book of endocrinology that is thicker than any other book you ve ever read
 antonismetallidis they don t need to understand the mechanics instead try to create a teaching environment that guides kids to feel rewarded during effort
 you went to the wrong school or rather didn t attend the classes for long enough
 tbbb tools books blade amp bones congratulations on being clever enough to make sure you went to the right schools and be able to be such a diligent student what a supreme being you must be
 dr nh oo oh well thankyou but i m not flattered try again some other day kid
 tbbb tools books blade amp bones on tuesday just passed your flattery will get you far lmao i am proudly childlike often
 if i had knowledge of the dopamine process by huberman lab years ago it could have solved my years of pain why is it not covered in freshman sociology or psychology
 antonismetallidis br most could or build a vocab for it how many of us learn at first exposure
 boogerbust build a vocab for it how many of us learn at first exposure
 amy boyd green i imagine because he is sharing a lot of new research but unfortunately also because his fixes are not easily exploited for profit quite the opposite in that it is information that could free many
 i agree but technically it is indirectly taught in relgion spirtuality br e g meditaiton visualisaiton meditation in buddhism will stabilise your dopamine baselines and help control the mind etc br though they didn t know the molecular neuroscience the practices still work
 school s not really meant to teach anything useful it s mostly a way for lazy people who don t want to do any hard work to feel useful and smart by babysitting children and teenagers
 bc ma that is true of many professionsi would hope not for most but i probably wouldnt be socked if the numbers showed that so many people do not even know what motivates them at all we can rarely if ever be fully aware it is important to have some trust in our institutions without that we are up the proverbial with no paddle but good luck with that i guess br go well
 this is taught in the first two years of medical school we learned all about this in neuro physio biochemistry basic stuff
 mj basic stuff for those with the privilege of medical school i hope at least you are able to integrate this knowledge into your future work and maybe find occasion to enable others to access the same most of all please try to check your biases and meet your future patients where they are not where you assume them to be
 i learned this in school big time
 rufio make the most of that privilege
 antonismetallidis the year old version of myself would not absorb this but maybe a high schooler definitely
 all i wanna say is that br they don t really care about us
 i am and am blown away
 not sure if all these mechanism were such well known years ago
 instead they ll teach us mathematical equations that can be done on calculators in the rare instance that we ever need to do them and spend an entire semester analysing film conventions used in baz luhrmanns romeo and juliet as if this sort of thing should be common knowledge or something we learn in our own time
 because neuroscience wasn t so advanced when you were a school kid br it would be more than nave to think that school is the panacea of life
 this is college level material and if you havent studied in college or read this stuff on your own youre not going to know about it
 hello andrew huberman br i can t believe i have not discovered your content until now as someone who is in the process of changing a lot of things in my life with quot functioning quot adhd that left me fine until now your videos are helping me really change my life
 check your diet
 this was an amazing and informative episode thank you for a deep dive into dopamine
 booom i can t remember to have ever seen a video as informative entertaining illustrative b motivating b and life changing as this i already knew a lot about dopamine but this video goes far beyond the technicalities of dopaminergic mechanisms
 andrew thank you ever so much education and awareness is the tools that can make humanity thrive and the lack of those might lead us back to the dark age of superstitious and emotional decision making selves that we by all means should get over with and make that leap of faith into the only possible state of existence then self recognition and acceptance of ourselves as we were created
 for me this was the first video of dr huberman here it is really amazing and i am wondering why such scientific knowledge is not imparted in the school curriculum if this is given to minors at appropriate time then many types of crimes and suicide attempts can be reduced br many thanks to dr andrew huberman for this video
 after listening to this podcast i laced up my running shoes and went for a hour run on the snowy former berlin airport c no music and no podcast for the majority of it i felt so damn frozen and but also so damn high and accomplished br thank you so much prof for all the work you do you are a great teacher
 great job mate keep it up
 just the beginning
 im tired right i will keep it up aiming to run that marathon eventually not for the sake of the marathon but for the sake of the journey a k a the effort itself
 for the effort buddy
 thats very healthy for your cardiovascular system and mental strength good stuff
 dont catch cold
 how does that make sense if you receive little dopamine from doing something that produces discomfort instead you mean to say that discomfort produces dopamine
 hogsa discomfort releases adrelaine and i assume adrelaine and dopamine are linked
 i would love to join you fella berliner
 woohoo another fellow berliner here hope your dopamine and marathon goals are getting closer
 why no music tho
 good job
 thank you andrew for the knowledge you keep on providing its priceless
 you are a star prof dr huberman listening to you has supported me get thru my prof doc programme thank you a million
 subscribed love your videos all this knowledge and it s very well put together and easy to understand br thank you you re a legend
 this video changed my life for the better oh my its like im looking at the world from a new healthier perspective i feel like i now know the tools to approach life differently and sustain joy and happiness
 great podcast i listened in awe i was wondering if theres any point at which an activity stops being pleasurable even if the strategies outlined in this episode are implemented for example i love exercise and i really do mean that i get a lot of pleasure from it im concerned that because i do it so often and because i started so early in life will it become become less pleasurable over the course of my life as my baseline dopamine decreases
 this was incredibly generous and packed with information an online masterclass like this would be sold for hundreds of dollars and you ve shared it for free big gratitude
 thank you for ur work i have a moderate eclectic education in different areas from philosophy to dental hygiene to oriental medicine i have a genetic tendency for addiction your information snd presentation is inspiring and helpful for understanding behavior thank you
 andrew thank you and your team got back my yerba mate cup from kitchen cupboard and my mind on dopamine very interesting and mindset changing
 amazing video specially for us young people who has just started a life in my case a business which has lots of things to do and should be motivated to be able to function properly br i appreciate it
 what a terrfific content from a terrific man i would like to thank you very much for all the huge effort put on this vedio and in others truly a massive contribution to the world with all the valuable pieces of information shared thank you from the bottom of the heart
 this information is beyond valuable for so many people i have so many questions also this is me blindly asking but if cold water therapy works unsure how it works exactly but does that mean being out in cold winter climate also creates the same levels of dopamine i cant imagine it would bc i live somewhere so cold and we are all depressed here ive been medicated for adhd for years and now really regretting this form of tx bc i have massive burn out in my s what seems like beyond repairable burn out im lethargic and viewed as lazy by my partner but i just have zero energy to live most days my dr wants me to see a sleep specialist bc i sleep too much and he thinks i may have narcolepsy i always just say its my busy schedule with kids my classes and work but he thinks it goes beyond that i sleep so soundly so it couldnt be that im not getting quality sleep i keep thinking now maybe its the adderall long term burn out
 late to this but this content is a total game changer for me was struggling what the heck was wrong with my brain super grateful for your work it s not much but hope this tiny support helps and definitely subscribing
 yeah man
 cheers hang in there fam
 be well

 probably the most informative and educative subject on wellness and wellbeing i ve heard yet br br layman question what is if any the connection between dopamine and testosterone levels in men thank you very much
 excellent informative potentially life changing i am grateful for the incredible insights offered in this podcast who would have guessed that so many of us are simply brought up and conditioned to chase and justify such pursuits of d releasing activities and substances as if it is the most normal thing in the world not realising the debilitiating and sabotaging effects on one s life and future the entire commercial and quot pop quot culture world is dewsigned to hook and enslave you
 this video changed my lifethank you andrew huberman you are a great human being for sharing your knowledge keep doing it and improving peoples lives
 one of the most precious channels on youtube i can t believe it and really regret that i didn t discover this channel much earlier
 thank you so much for this profound podcast you do great job
 dr huberman basing on the several recent episodes i ve come to an understanding that if one would eliminate activities that make the brain release high portions of dopamine for days and more dopamine receptors would eventually start to respond to lower portions of dopamine then later on previously boring activities would start to be perceived by the brain as interesting ones and they would become higher dopamine activities therefore mitigating adhd symptoms and making focusing on them easier in other words to be able to love doing hard things that are good in the long perspective one must get rid of short term gratification activities br is this correct br br edit i wrote this comment as soon i saw the video released hoping my question would be noticed because as far as i ve noticed dr huberman answers questions in the comment section on the day of release of a video so i did not watch the video then the answer to my question and other similar questions below is at
 just in case he doesn t respond i think you are pretty much right i only know due to extensive research on porn addiction the dopamine release from watching porn can be as addictive and powerful as cocaine for example there is plenty of research into the impact abstaining from porn has on the brain from those that watch it regularly most individuals tend to go through a flatline where the body is screaming out for that dopamine release and the individual goes through a depressive period however beyond the day mark they begin to enjoy activities that didn t interest them as much are much happier more productive etc just giving themselves that break from the overpowering dopamine feast that is porn seems to almost reset the brain i find it fascinating
 lol not just porn even masturbation
 i tried this but went too hard crashed and burned and fell in all old paterns and adhd kicked in to the max after
 i understood it this way as well but would be highly interested in professor hubermans answer
 theyeking a real deadly combination for sure
 yes i believe you are true i have started facing my first boss smoking
 if you try it i think you ll find it to be true everything will come bursting back to life once you begin to reset those levels
 this is why many religions have practices or fasting and giving up things you love for a given period
 michaelmcdonagh thank you for your answer i recently stopped watching porn and i can confirm that in the last week i have been feeling like that in this upcoming weekend i ll have a party weekend in berlin probably with dopamine stimulants do you think it would be safer for me that i just start watching pornography until next week so that i don t feel any sort of dependence on the stimulants i know this is a far fetched question but i m genuinely interested ahah
 change quot limit quot to quot must get rid of quot no harm in short term gratification activities in small controlled doses
 schijtaccount did you stop taking your medication or something
 i ve been meditating on this for a while as well i had a theory that the more you participate in highly dopaminergically stimulating activities sex drugs foods intense activity it draws from a limited resource of fuel that is your dopamine and it also closes the doors that lead to adaptation for new activities or lets say raises the amount of pressure needed to open them making you focus on the activity you are using to deplete your dopamine for better or worse it s a pretty revelatory insight and these videos have totally confirmed this is pretty accurate and gives a lot more helpful info
 i think this is already known as a dopamine detox i seen a yt video explaining the same concept it was called how to make your brain like doing hard things again or something like that
 flying machine goodluck smoking is tough to kick but can be done w the right mindset
 masturbation to what effect on the brain
 days without internet and tv connection
 flying machine highly recommend trying out nicotine pouches i quit smoking pretty effortlessly with them i actually got off them pretty easily as well and am now nicotine free they have different strengths usually between mg so you can start high and work your way down check around for coupons online if you try them out i was a pack a day for years best of luck you got it
 i think you just explained the bible
 sort of dopamine fasting similarly i have found out that when i eat bland food tasteless then for some reason my motivation rises i have more focus and adhd symptoms subside as if my body strengthens me in order to chase objectives and get the reward that does not receive from simple everyday things like food
 michalisk this is interesting so it is a motivational hack sort of speaking br i wonder how often can you do it successfully and if this is true for most people with adhd
 pretty much but don t forget all of the other aspects such as nutrition exercise proper sleep etc
 gasparleite take your stims if you feel it but do so with the firm awareness that it s just for a special occasion and remember dosage is key know your limits take a multi month break thereafter br br stay away from porn if possible and after the party dedicate yourself to tough activities exercise cold showers etc br br you ll be ok
 i ve been doing something similar to what you describe br br everytime i got something to do but i can t find the motivation or drive to start doing it i just stop doing what i m doing and try to isolate myself from anything that can distract me which is hard because i can play with a rubber band for hours br br then i just try to stop thinking and imagining things and just attempt to get as bored as possible br br after about minutes of thought suppression i feel the drive of starting the thing i needed to do and the achievement of doing something beneficial is so good i then can do the next thing i need to do
 theyeking it seems that what makes porn much more dangerous than masturbation is that the first releases waaaaaay more dopamine not sure if theres any measurement but i guess it would be at least x higher and the anticipation dopamine spike from porn could be triggered by any internet device which is everywhere
 yes you are almost correct the time period for upregulation half life of dopamine receptors and resetting of transcription factors such as creb line up with that time period of weeks fosb also decreases but only a miniscule amount which is why if you relapse you can go back to your shitty self of being a dopamine junky in no time whatever the source of the addiction may be drugs porn or technology
 i am addicted to reading fiction and tv series its sabotaging my studies what to do any advices
 is this why jesus fasted for days
 shahrock just stop yourself from doing it there is no easy way as soon as you see you get that urge of doing something turn off the tv it doesn t matter if you start studying right away br just stop doing what prevents you from raising your dopamine
 michaelmcdonagh what kind of behavior would i need to remove for days in order to accomplish this does this include any kind of non productive entertainment entirely so yes to sports studying work etc but no to netflix social media scrolling sugar etc
 gasparleite as a life rule i would advise most people to not use porn at all the harms definitely outweigh benefits but definitely do not rely on it to help you cope with any sort of stimulants you plan on taking if you are going to take recreational drugs get them tested first test kits are cheap and worthwhile and once they ve worn off get good quality sleep eat a healthy meal fruit and veggies and go for a walk
 me with adhd just eliminate activities that produce high amounts of dopamine for days he says this had me slapping my knee br br honestly i will try to sit with boredom more people seldom do these days
 update i wrote this comment as soon i saw the video released hoping my question would be noticed because as far as i ve noticed dr huberman answers questions in the comment section on the day of release of a video so i did not watch the video then the answer to my question and other similar questions below is at
 gasparleite porn is very different to drugs porn is much more addictive because its normal you get high from it in your own private space and you are pretty much to the outside world normal afterwards it also scratches the most primal itch we have sex and reproduction taking cocaine or whatever youll take on the weekend is an unusual activity for you and is done in a foreign setting youre very unlikely to get addicted to the dopaminergic drugs you take once every few months at a party where everyone else is whether you begin to smash your dopamine receptors with a hammer by watching porn for a few days will have no affect on the outcome of the party except that youll probably feel less social more awkward and enjoy it less
 i guess it s like eating rice for two weeks so that you start to like the taste of vegetables except that eating only rice for weeks isn t always safe and probably not a good idea
 sendnoodles sitting with boredom is really good youre on the right track
 gasparleite what do you mean by dopamine stimulant ive been no porn for month and guarantee you dont let your brain make excuse to watch porn again because of something if you can avoid both case then avoid it if you want to choose just chose the one you ve been long done it
 yes dopamine fasting is good one must get rid of short term gratification one must think of effort itself as the reward don t get any dopamine highs before and after effort so that you ll have a decent amount of base dopamine when you arrive to effort and you won t crave for any other things that d come after effort if you do all these the effort itself is gonna be the thing that you crave for pretty much
 sendnoodles there are things that can help with the feeling of boredom i do know what you mean and had to do this myself there is mindfulness being in the now not thinking about what happened or what will happen but what is happening now or not so park yourself in nature and just focus on that it could be gardening even motorcycle maintenance something that takes focus get into that and enjoy that remember not to get wound up by it or meditate meditation can take many forms there are many tracks on youtube alone that are to help calm your brain or a calm piece of music you enjoy to relax to lastly focus on your breathing excellent focus for slowing your bodily system down the more you breathe slowly the calmer your heart becomes the better you feel good luck
 itsmidtrib lol
 this b sounds nice b but the notion that starving yourself of exciting things to regulate your dopamine levels actually works is complete pseudoscience your brain is constantly adapting to fast and efficiently for you to quot trick it quot into working differently
 flying machine along with your other tools for quitting include bupropion wellbutrin zyban etc it s helpful for all addictive behaviors i think quitting smoking is a bear so use every tool you can find
 schijtaccount how many days were you able to abstain it should be more than to see any results
 dalpaengi try meditation instead it can be boring watch your breath try it mins day for a month see how it effects you after the month
 that is really interesting and makes total sense an extreme example of this was tried on me when i had bad cfs chronic fatigue syndrome the idea is that the patient takes mini doses of low dose naltrexone to block the dopamine chemistry so that eventually the brain is tricked and adjusts and start to make a lot more i found this hideous because i noticed within a few days i couldn t derive pleasure or any sense of reward from any activity whatsoever and actually found it difficult to get out of bed after i went for a five mile run which was one hundred times more difficult than normal on these pills and didn t have runners high or even feel better in any way i stopped taking them however part of me wished i could have persisted longer just to see what it would have created
 wow i only wished i had learned this sooner in life this is truly life changing and never really considered how much dopamine effects feelings energy levels and motivate
 dr huberman thank you for this episode i m watching you from uzbekistan literaly this episode is pure goodness you can t imagine how beneficial this episode is for me and i hope it will be helpful for my collegues and relatives as well i will share this episode with them br br i want to ask you to make an episode about biohacking i e to what aspects of health should we focus to boost our mental and health productivity for example i know that to have good level of productivity i should good gut health gut microbiomes sleep and etc but could you make an episode with sum up of all essential aspect of health condition to biohack and reach highest level of productivity
 thank you andrew for sharing your precious knowledge with other people
 im glad that i found this podcast im smart and talented but struggled with add my whole life glad im starting to get it under control and build a rewarding life and be of service to others
 this is absolutely life changing podcast
 so to recap br don t trigger dopamine all the time even if gained through various sources try to dopamine fast br cold showers can raise dopamine without the crash br don t layer in dopamine raising activities with things you want to get more motivated for e g listening to music while working br don t reward yourself before or after hard activities let the activity itself produce dopamine br br anything i missed
 ah intermittent schedule of celebrating your wins don t celebrate every time and use a randomiser to dictate when to celebrate
 exception to the rule is caffeine i e coffee tea
 cold showers don t last long enough for the effect of cold bathing it s was like min to hour exposure at least
 speed time stamp for that if you can i didn t catch that one
 wow ur no fun thanks for that
 sadly we reward everything our children do well rather than allowing their achievements be the reward makes our children wimps
 misstrunchbull somewhere in the beginning of the video basically coffee does not raise dopamine as much as these other activities also cold showers if done regularly do not increase dopamine as high as the first time second time etc therefore they shouldbe done intermittently
 kos may i ask how have cold showers changed your life
 number is hard i layer in music to keep myself focused
 jamesyeang me too due to noise in office
 don t layer in dopamine raising activities with things you want to get more motivated for e g listening to music while working can you explain this i don t fully understand this point
 eugeniusbenediktusx it s quite counter intuitive and took ah a while to get the point across would recommend watching that part unfortunately i don t know the timestamp
 eugeniusbenediktusx as far as i understand the point is that you raise your dopamine cap for the next time you ll do that particular activity so if you re used to listen to music before studying or working when you don t get the chance you ll fell like shit and won t be as motivated you basically add more conditions to your performance also if you release a lot of dopamine by adding up many pleasurable activities you ll increase your dopamine but undergo a crash later this is true for any activity the guy also said that basically people that are very active and get to do many dopaminergic activities in the long run end up like addicts in the sense that they don t feel the same drive they used to before that s because you keep getting highs all the time the rule is beside cold showers every time you get dopamine you ll undergo a low too so the highs can t be too high and can t be too many because the consequence will be bigger crashes time stamp
 also social media in general are bad because they basically let us waste dopamine that would be released in other circumstances pleasure and dopamine can basically become a conscious choice if we deprive ourselves from dopaminergic situations or behaviours the ones that do give us dopamine will become very pleasurable
 writing a question here since it s one of the most popular comments so i should start to appreciate effort so that eventually dopamine is released when doing something hard that s all good but then i ll get dopamine every time i do something hard and that will still be bad no how do i modulate dopamine releases intermittently if the end goal is to get dopamine every time i work hard and my goal is to work hard every day hopefully somebody will reply eventually cheers
 so people will just read that summary which is the cause of not able to watch long videos because it became too hard for people to focus on benefitial long term things like reading book watching these kinds of videos as there are many things which can fulfill our pleasure immediately like porn social media which also makes us to feel sad at the end of the day
 northernwildshewolf the achievement shouldnt be the reward the process itself should be
 although a long video like this should be timestamped it may be a real problem if people don t listen to dr hubermann but only read the comments and time stamps i ve listened to this and other of his videos a few times now but am still not completely focused because i ll only listen in the night to fall asleep actually one should listen to him while cleaning or jogging and listen to him from start to the end he s that good also he has already created helpful time stamps
 northernwildshewolf didn t even think about that o
 northernwildshewolf check out montessori way of bringing up children br i never made this connection before listening to this talk br montessori says explicitly to never say quot good job quot as a general statement but to say quot you are doing well at walking the stair quot and advices to celebrate effort rather than result br and that way of bringing up children is from
 mortalkomment again don t layer your dopamine inducing activities
 do not mix caffeine and mdma while partying stick with the good old water
 let the journey be the destination cliche for a good reason
 i am extremely thankful for this recap as i am comming back to this after a long time and in desperate need of a dopamine detox and was wondering how to truly do it and it s am and i really want to do it as soon as possible thank you so much i totally forgot about cold showers
 eugeniusbenediktusx
 does cold shower trigger a decrease in the baseline when the effect of the increase is ended or is it the fact that the level is decreasing so slowly that the level doesn t go under the baseline
 thank you very much for your summary i appreciate it
 misstrunchbull
 be tw de somebody answer this man s question
 pecoguy ice water bath
 zeus all part of their plan they know exactly what they are doing to the population br much love
 northernwildshewolf dang i think you re totally right
 q
 about the one so pomodoro is bad
 northernwildshewolf everyone does that even the adults its just a common thing for all humans not a children thing
 pg instead of music perhaps try ear plugs or noise cancellation headphones
 be tw de i think once you do things that are hard and finish them your next task should be a little bit harder to challenge you and hence give u an additional dopamine rush
 be tw de enjoying hard work is going to increase the baseline dopamine and the intermittent thing is specifically for activities that spike dopamine i hope i helped
 misstrunchbull
 petera
 thank you for your numbered summarization you saved me hours of time that would have been largely wasted
 arcticsilverfox but you didn t work for it and accepted the characterizations of others
 how many minutes under cold shower he reccomends please in order to get focus and clarity thanks
 petera although the way i like my coffee does sugar and chocolate are my favorite additions oops maybe i should change that
 filipzserlav it doesn t work it s one more bullchit piece of advice for the poor man ritalin works adderall works that s all that works for now
 be tw de i like to think about it in that your brain receptors are equilibrium seeking set the equilibrium high and it will be difficult to achieve it so you ll always feel low set it low and achieving it will be so easy you ll always feel fine with occasional spikes of greatness that you have to allow yourself to recover from the more dopamine you give yourself the higher that bar becomes which is why quot dopamine detoxing quot is so popular what you re really doing is decreasing the intensity of dopamine release allowing the receptors to upregulate and keep your baseline at a better more fulfilling level constant use of porn sugar video games drugs or even the more innocuous music podcasts etc will bring your baseline down to the point where dull moments become unbearably dull waiting for your doctor s appointment becomes so boring you immediately jump to memes on your phone rather than sit quietly a minute or read a book reading a nonfiction textbook for class becomes arduous without music a sugary latte adderall and the promise of chocolate at the end because you ve forced low dopamine activities to be high ones and now your brain thinks the lower dopamine state is abysmally low by comparison
 amazing recap
 be tw de lets avoid quot good quot and quot bad quot and just talk about what would happen so if you are very affective at convincing yourself that hardworking is rewarding you will get a spike in dopamine every time you work hard the more friction you experience the bigger the spike if you are getting big spikes all the time from hard work your baseline of dopamine will fall and you will crave hard work when this goes further you will essentially be addicted to hardwork you ll crave it nothing else will be satisfying and even hard work itself won t do much for you br br if you actually become addicted to hard work that probably means you re doing well in terms of accomplishing things but you won t feel good at that point all you need to do is take a break from hard work or avoid the feeling of high friction from there you can try to find the right balance to maintain a high dopamine baseline or you can just accept that every once in a while you have to take a break br br this wouldn t be the worst problem to have lol
 now for a question of my own from my interpretation if someone wanted to be extreme and only cared about working on their goals they should cut out all pleasurable activities anything that spikes dopamine that do not work toward their goals this will leave you with the highest baseline dopamine you can have while forcing you to look to working towards your goals for any dopamine spikes at all does that sound right to you guys
 akinolaorederu yesss sir
 strengthening thd believe that positive activities that we are engaged in e g sports cold shower interinttent fasting and etc will have stronger positive effects on the outcomd
 stopmakingstupidpeoplefamous me personally i never get bad cold anymore and i hated being sick so much
 northernwildshewolf ok boomer
 misstrunchbull
 i listen to music while working out but it s never my favorite music just really heavy stuff to stimulate aggression i also watch ufc these things may trigger b some b dopamine but the upside of keeping me focused and energized seems well worth it am i missing something
 arcticsilverfox nah your missing out he gave gems
 the studies were about submerging in cold water not showers br you can and you should layer dopamine raising activities with things you want to get more motivated for ut you shouldn t do it every time you should randomly switch it up sometimes layer it sometimes not
 northernwildshewolf amazing eh people know what they are doing in schools is counter effective but it s pushed anyway

 what if the thing you do produces no dopamine doing dishes makes me anxious at best makes me cry with anxiety at worst no amount of doing dishes on their own is going to feel rewarding enough to just be able to do it certainly doesn t increase dopamine and i am on antianxiety meds
 autumnsilverwolves use a dishwasher
 cedarave lol
 yeah you missed something you need the nutrients to create dopamine and serotonin in the first place so if you want an abundance and a quick pooling of dopamine recovery you need the stuff to create it in the first place i feel a huge difference after looking into this i can get a huge rush of dopamine release just by listening to music now and it doesnt even feel like a crash afterwards cause the body is able to create so much of it i recomend researching what nutrients dopamine needs hint its basically all of them just get all the nutrients the body needs and u need to research which nutrients those are and where u get them from i found this after i had a whole year of depression cause of a folate deficiency if youre deficient in something that is needed for dopamine then you will have low no matter what magnesium deficiency makes dopamine low too just research and get everything and you wil feel awesome
 what is tool number

 dont reward yourself before or after what am i supposed to do for the next few hours cant watch tv play games be on the phone or hit the gym kind of hard to find something to do im thinking maybe short meditation maybe taking a long walk
 thank you so much for posting this in the comment section
 jacobjanes had the same question if going to the gym increases dopamine then when exactly am i supposed to schedule it in before getting hard work done huberman says no dopamine before otherwise itll make the work harder to endure but then he also says no dopamine after because that would be associating dopamine to reward also say i dont engage in any dopamine peaking behavior until after completing hard work is any sort of action i do in the hours after ex use social media considered to be a reward what else are we supposed to do after and then when else can we just relax to use our phones or watch tv or whatever
 jacobjanes no dopamine before hard work gym because your dopamine will dip afterwards while you re exercising and not rewarding yourself after hard work gym is based on the logic that you ll associate the hard work gym with the reward and not learn to release dopamine while working hard itself our goal so try to not associate hard work with reward by not getting cheap dopaminergic hits afterwards like using social media watching a movie or tv show masturbating etc instead you can do things that are neither reward nor work like making amp eating healthy food after exercising taking a shower not too enjoyable adjust the temp accordingly doing dishes etc depends on what you find neutral these days then after an hour or so you can follow the same protocol of not spiking dopamine too much by adding cheap dopaminergic activities together like in my case not watching an episode of a tv show while checking social media from time to time shut you smartphone down not checking news not drinking something with high sugar not pausing it and opening a yt video in a new tab not sitting in very bad but enjoyable posture not chewing a gum not replying to messages etc
 tnx
 be tw de effort won t release a dopamine spike it will just raise the baseline enough to keep you working i think that s the conclusion i came up with
 northernwildshewolf same goes for punishment
 if effort gives me dopamine shouldn t i skip doing it regularly
 yeah you missed that being a human came with a very complicated set of rules and our lives suck either way
 robin getting a rush seems beyond the entire point
 can anybody remind me how long do i need to be in the cold shower for i seem to not find this information
 how long should the cold showers be sec minute minutes he said not one hour but didnt specify any time
 no music while working death is a preferable alternative
 i listened to this and didnt get the same reaction as everyone to me it was a lot of contradictory dos and donts but its ok but its not ok didnt make a lot of sense to me
 mortalkomment i agree this would be an awesome video it could be sold in stores on how to get a good nights sleep
 i agree it should be a great video to help you get a good nights sleep he can sell his videos to help get people replenished from a hard day because it just about put me to sleep forget the sound of rain or soft music this video would work best
 great podcast my second time around i think and on the third i m going to take notes thank you dr h
 this knowledge is pure gold may everyone learn this secret and are able to apply in whatever they pursue
 in a word mindfulness br in a few more words and additionally quot everything in moderation including moderation quot br thank you dr huberman i m releasing dopamine right now at the prospect of implementing now with more knowledge these age old words of wisdom
 amazing podcast totally understand and enjoyed it
 thank you so much for this amazing content so deeply appreciate it
 i ve had a dopamine release listening this it s a priceless podcast thank you so much for doing it
 now be careful to spike the dopamine than required by not adding other stimulants and taking a break after the podcast to reset the base line levels writing summary of the points and moving onto some boring task might help too p me trying to be dopamine engineer here
 ay eq rw nice one mate
 dear dr huberman thank you for your post about dopamine i tried l tyrosine and cold shower but my cortisol level is low and i feel worse afterwards brain fog insomnia always around
 thank you prof for this amazing lecture is there a way to increase the releasable or reserve pool of dopamine
 the most beneficial video on youtube by consciously knowing the physical reaction in my body and to a better plan to approach my daily life this well change my life thank you
 great info i work with addicts who are in the first days of recovery ive already incorporated some of this info into my work it helps because early recovery is a huge struggle and now i can tell them good embrace that theyre dopamine is all outta wack myself ive been clean over years im an artist i rent out a space and i struggle with low energy and low motivation hx of depression hx of ptsd sad im a year old female ive incorporated your sleep tools to get that area of my life functional i workout im social how do i suss out when to lean into the struggle and when i need something else im not where i want to be yet everything feels difficult i expect part of it is just aging
 i am with you there life is flipping tough
 hi dr huberman excellent video as usual i am from india and we have been taught since ages to take a cold bath in the morning esp in the river if it is near you and though i tried hard to understand the rational behind it i couldnt thanks to you for making it clear the more i watch and study your podcasts the more i admire our ancient sages as they praticed and taught what scientiests are doing now getting up in the morning having a ice cold bath in the river then having light food in the brakefast having dinner before sunset to sleeping at in the night made them amazingly healthy and sane i am trying to adopt some practices in my life and started to take a cold bath slowly and gradually thanking you once again for sharing these insights love and respect from india
 this episode is far better than any other motivational video i came across on youtube keep doing what you re doing dr huberman you re positively impacting many people s lives with this content
 indeed this is next level stuff
 man this podcast is absolutely precious only wish i found it earlier
 it would be really amazing if you guys could produce a one pager document that allows you to adopt some of these changes in your life have you some of the advice from the episode on breathing and turn it into repetitive google tasks around box breathing etc it would be good to see a one pager at the end that has a list of things you need to take away and implement perhaps even examples of how to implement you seem like basic changes that you can incorporate in life for this episode in my mind a basic coin flip every morning that determines whether i m going to watch youtube today or whether i ll be choosing breakfast dinner or lunch as my meal of the day or an open list to help an individual create awareness around there specific challenges where i can identify things where i m combining tasks that are giving me dopamine for me one combo is food and screens with a soft drink just a thought the work you guys are doing is great keep at it
 very interesting in the case of high performing athletes routines are important for good performance is intermitent reward for example in the routine of listening to music prior to a competition also applicable thank you for this great podcast
 this information is so helpful whenever i learn how things work on a deeper level it helps so much
 listening to this makes me realize that ive probably lived with a very low baseline all my life perhaps its testimony to my real strength that ive made it even this far in life
 everything you said today confirms many of my own experimentations with pleasure and dopamine you will truly experience life the most if you dont overindulge in the high dopamine behavior also learning how to enjoy the process instead of the reward and lastly to not expect a reward every time you work for it amazing insightful and so informative youre the best andrew
 grest advice giving up my vices has led to less excitrement highs and lows but much great peacr of mind flow i lool back at my behaviour and realise i was incredibly self destructive but can now see that much of that was dopa related
 same story here glad you feel so good now
 surfing is definitely an activity where i haven t noticed a significant if any drop in baseline after a high peak it has just made me feel good consistently
 its amazing that so much value can come from one video alone
 this is a really good podcast i have a question though as sometimes we want to do something but not able to plan confused about where to start and also have fear of fail how dopamine can keep us motivated here and help us start working in this situation
 this is a life changing podcast thank you so much andrew huberman
 thankyou for your work releasing this free of charge is a beautiful gift to the world that is changing lives mine included
 thank you for your interest in science best wishes andrew
 i thought i was suffering from depression wow i m in shock of what learn from listening to you you nail it
 i did a day meditation retreat and the difference was unreal everything looked brighter and shiny even the weeds in the cracks in the paving were beautiful
 this information completely changed my life in terms of decision making because i used to think i need to be optimal in everything i do and i can do lot of things at the same time
 thank you andrew your podcast helped me with overcoming my depression i am back to work finally
 i spent most of my research career studying dopamine and the n s pathway as an in vivo electrophysiologist this is an excellent and easily digested overview review i m currently retired from science but am doing literature reviews on the neuroscience of quot creativity quot
 do you have any types of sources for where the creativity research from you or others is
 i live in a state of near dopamine high and always happy and in a good mood i learned how to control my dopamine with thoughts and posture since a teen and i am now i dont have lows talked about in the video but i do experience bad i just quickly realize how i am feeling and ask myself if the mood i am experiencing is optimal for my situation i found being happy is where i make the best decisions and i want to be always in that state to stack positive results
 this was really a helpful video for me thank you for giving me a understanding for my actions
 lifechanging video this knowledge is priceless thank u for explaining all of these complex ideas so simply and well
 wow thank you for this awesome piece of mind blowing learning off the chart
 big thanks to to you mr huberman i really was looking for this info because i heve add and now at years old i finally understand that my personal struggle and choises most cone down to a dopamine search to much smoking eating and lots of coffee with this info i can finally impact that behavior
 going through a dip in motivation this video was extremely helpful for some reason it feels like when you start understanding things about your brain and body at an intellectual level something clicks in you something that somehow helps
 same for me buddy
 this is so true this is exactly how i felt
 it feels like when you start understanding things about your brain and body at an intellectual level something clicks in you may be this is also releasing dopamine
 aashu ahuja very true
 that s why they say quot knowledge is power quot
 through this podcast i finally understand why everytime i play with my phone i have no motivation to do anything else i feel extremely low energy that is because when i play with my phone i experience dopamine peak so it is very hard to put it down after i have to put the phone down i experience dopamine drop i feel worse after i understand that i have more motivation to leave my phone at home i feel more motivated at work now thanks andrea your podcast save a lot of people s life i am so lucky to be one of them
 i was always sleepy throughout the day and when i do take a nap i would wake up with a headache which makes it hard to do any work that requires mental effort i dont have any faith but i tried the cold shower exposure caffeine and some chocolate in the morning now i rarely get sleepy and noticed that i seem to have endless energy throughout the day it was a life changing experience ive been doing it for a few weeks now so thank you so much for this valuable information
 what a life changing piece of information that is available for free on the internet thank you mr hubberman
 this podcast is pretty good i listened full of this this podcast gives me more knowledge about dopamine thanks you prof andew huberman and huberman lab s team
 good morning thanks for the relevant info you could tackle the topic of stress in police work especially in the crucial events of danger and interview the author of the book quot on combat quot dave grossman
 this podcast was amazing as someone who suffers from depression this was so eye opening thank you
 i found you through just leaving youtube on while i sleep bc im still scared of the dark lol im gonna start watching you more bc i usually just watch reaction channels of movies and stuff which is a waste of time i want to start being motivated more bc i usually only stay motivated for a few weeks at a time and then fall back down for a month or so and that just repeats i really find this stuff fascinating i just wish i could remember all of the information i ve always felt like im not smart bc i can t retain the majority of things when im trying to learn especially if it s things im not interested in i ve never been to a psychologist and still wonder if i have adhd or something
 midway through this pod and i would definitely like to say that this podcast is a eye opener and have a crucial depth in it submerging urself in a cheap dopamine will last no longer try to endulge yourself in a rich dopamine thats what last longer
 incredible thank you for the work on this one
 this man is a wizard thank you for sharing your priceless knowledge with us
 brazilian jiu jitsu really is so perfect for this aside from tournaments the dopamine i feel when i win in a roll is small it s just a little ping of satisfaction that my training is paying off it will be offset by many many many failures and losses even within one class then very occasionally you manage to surprise yourself and your training partner by overcoming a dilemma that normally gets you or you submit a higher belt who was really trying to give it their all those occasions give you a nice warm fuzzy feeling that makes you want to keep training but rarely do i ever get an intense craving to do jiu jitsu
 professor i love the way you explain things in a way that both people who are really interested in neurobiology and the people who are not can understand i am grateful for the effort time and energy probably tears too you put into this podcast world needs more people like you
 la

 thank you for telling me all this i m actually training in preparation for doing an iron man and when you were talking about the effort being the reward and how powerful it is to access i found myself nodding in agreement br br many people ask me how i able to put myself through all this training when the reward is an even more grueling challenge with the actual iron man event the fact is that i love the challenge the effort is the reward i dont do this training just so i can eat whatever i want or relax in the evening it is its own reward i ve already unlocked this part of the dopamine reward system
 is br my p
 incredibly smart handsome man explaining difficult stuff as simple as possible i mean its just a whole joy to listen br your speech is actually genius because its understandable so its easy to memorize br thank you so
 your a good teacher you kept me engaged the hole video and thats rare he is wright natraualy working towards a goal and achieving it is better than any chemical high i ve experienced both
 thank you dr huberman very insightful do you have any episodes geared more towards unmotivated teenagers my year old is struggling with motivation but is a curious being and will watch such talks with me given the abundance of disturbing online porn and street drugs i also want him to understand the ramifications of falling for short term satisfactions
 every time i watch a huberman video i feel like i just got an entire semester of knowledge in hours he is a national treasure
 i am a frequent user of youtube for more than years this is undoubtedly the most insightful valuable material i have watched btw this is my first ever comment written thanks andrew
 key takeaways for quick navigation br br
 this is probably the longest video i have watched on youtube with my full intrest i have always wondered why ppl say to not focus on the end results but the process itself i always doubted this feeling but now i m fully aware of why should i focus on the process i don t wanna ruin my dopamine system with all those short lived pleasurable activities long sustained dopamine level amp happy life is what is crave for
 absolutely amazing podcast i learned so much about how dopamine works i am dealing with adhd i went the natural way mr andrew i would like you to talk about saffron extract it has changed my life and helped me so much with adhd i wish u could talk about that herb br br god bless
 i am fromafrica and i enjoy and learn a lot with dr huberman s podcast thank you
 as someone who was using vvyanse weed nicotine caffeine and seratonin dopamine meds daily to overcome my absolute loss of motivation and severe depression this is genuinely life changing even just from a mindset perspective even at the absolute minimum that i ve taken away from this video i feel renewed knowing that i have more control over my drive than i ever thought this has given me hope and i thank you
 i ve not watched this yet but you sound similar to me looking forward to watching
 i wish it did the same to me i was just getting annoyed with all the technical crap throughout the entire episode knowing the intricacies of how neurons work is just not applicable found myself fast forwarding of the episode got more from the comment sections than anything
 love this comment
 ulogy i actually enjoyed the scientific info although i can certainly understand it is not for everyone
 jeeze i was accidentally doing a fair amount of this back in my college years and i loved life was so excited for the future was proud of myself was excelling everything was great then i left college and because i didn t know i was doing these my baseline dopamine just dropped and dropped drinking eating loud music etc now i feel like i ve been re united with an old friend who made me feel the best i ever have thank you sincerely this time i m doing it on purpose because i want to
 thank you so much for all the infomation you provide us
 if you are trying to get over an addiction this is the video you need
 great video thank you for providing it for free and explaining it in understandible form
 life changing content thank you so much
 not even halfway through the podcast and i m already compelled to write this that this is a pure gem of a lecture can t thank you enough sir keep smiling
 but enjoy intrinsic
 so you craved for pleasure and got it by writing this comment ha
 not sure if you have made a video on this before however it could be very interesting to learn about how external factors such as the people you engage with on a daily basis can affect dopamine levels examples of what i am talking about could be that another person you are around quite often has much lower levels of dopamine than you do how does this affect your personal dopamine levels
 thank you andrew you re changing lives
 excelente vdeo muitas informaes teis
 absolutely brilliant just started but absolutely loving it and will definitely catch up with the previous episodes andrews podcasts from now on will be my daily dose of inspiration along with of sam harris lex friedman jordan peterson and few others weve needded this content for a long time andrew thank you for your knowledge and clarity of presentations
 i have misused pleasures throughout my life without knowing that it could inflict this damage to my reward pathway thank you andrew this is godsent
 same for me i always wondered why sundays were crappy for me i thought it was because i had to go to work on mondays but now i realized it was all the dopamine highs i had saturday night
 same and working with children reward is used often now im questioning
 peter i have spent years destroying my motivation years on add drugs were the most vicious but this podcast will help me go forward i think there are a lot of us out here in the same boat
 for mr huberman br i love the way you talk about since and the valuable information you are giving her for free despite that i don t know you but i watched allot of your videos that it feels that i know you very well and i think many feels the same all what you recommend is very helpful and it makes more sense when you explain it in that vaccinating way you put the subject under study i believe you follow most of you recommend what i want to say is i find everything you recommend and explain in quot islam quot i really hope you read or at least read about islam from its trusted sources i am not that strict religious man despite that i see it very clear how everything can be this identical please consider my invitation for you to read quran and know more about islam as an invitation to look to the science from more deferent angles
 utterly grateful i found your channel sir
 i ll be coming back to this one in a week or thank you dr huberman
 the hole book of information just in hours thank you very much
 i just got dopamine release just by learning valuable information like this
 ive been thinking for years that theres something wrong with me and all it took was some knowledge about my own bodily systems to get me back on track with myself and now im all ready to make things better thank you huberman you are the best
 quot enjoy the suck quot uncle sam a decade after hearing that i realize it relates to dopamine modulation through the focused intent to try and enjoy anything one feels that they want to do or must do in life
 you sir are my new superhero thank you for this video and all you do i owe much credit to you sir
 hard work for the sake of hard work been working alot on self growth the past few years and must say developing the growth midset is definitely worth it they say its not about the destination its about the journey so to all those feeling is the destination worth it i have to say learning to appreciate the journey pitfalls and all keep moving forward
 very very much required video br br br i have kinda same thought about how our brain functions
 hi andrewhuberman i really liked this topic thank you i will try some things these days as soon as possible can i ask about dopamine system in highly sensitive persons brain i read some articles that it works different so i want to ask for your opinion
 as a pastor who struggles every week to study for my weekly sermons and other teaching a speaking engagements this information is incredibly valuable to me i am on a journey of trying to understand how to be motivated and develop healthier study habits it is so challenging for me however my calling depends on it
 congratulations keep pushing
 siddhantsikarwar ye sab bakchodi hai bhai partner vagera wo bhi online
 as somebody who isnt a pastor but an average working yo trying to push through college ive found that speaking to people especially through english class comes from the heart ive found that when people say this they dont realize it but they are saying to rather speak from calmness and resort your attention away from the constant nervous and hyperactive brain so when he mentions that a mixture between alertness and calmness is the perfect baseline mixture for a perfect baseline level of dopamine its ultimately referring to the distinguish between both i mentioned above in conclusion i think that is brilliant that youve used this podcast to improve in a certain aspect of hardships in your life and it would only be my duty to elaborate on the topic because i myself are going through a painful time in my life and i know exactly what you mean when you talk about preparing for lifes tasks


 thank you so much feel better after experiencing abandonment in my life i really need to get back control of my life
 i am really enjoying this video and tbh i ve always hated science but if it was taught to me on this level in school i prob would have did much better you made it relevent and personal for me thanks andrew
 this was beyond educating i appreciate all your efforts
 this has been by far the most helpful discussion on the dopamine i ve ever come across thank you so much i can t wait to practice what you ve talked about
 this plus the adhd one i second this statement
 this content is truly remarkable and i appreciate every aspect of it i encourage you to explore life from a creator s perspective as it could unveil valuable insights into the purpose and structure of dopamine our choices are ever evolving and i m delving deep br br love
 pure gold thank you for doing this for free br much respect and love for you professor

 i am amazed by the fact that this podcast is available for free it is pure gold
 youre so incredibly informative and articulate thank you
 very interesting and i think explains why i lost the ambition motivation to workout i am going to follow your suggestions of quot intermittent quot spiking of my dopamine
 well i enjoy listening to the huberman lab podcast whilst doing my cardio maybe i should consider doing it more intermittently

 lets say i would want to create a list of things to try out for quot drastically quot decreasing the amount of dopamine other then cold exposures such as cold showers etc or is cold exposures the best way to do so

 very great and valuable content thank yout
 it s your belated happy birthday dr andrew you are the best you helped so many people including me i feel my dopamine spiked when i saw you have a new episode

 daviareias i think it is on the th
 question about
 i ve hurt myself and others by not knowing these things it s borderline criminal not to teach this stuff at school show a teenager this one video and their entire life could be different
 practise generating feeling of extreme enthusiasm and excitement aka release dopamine br whenever br friction arises in mind and br you overcome the friction and start the task br br over a period of time your mind will link and relate friction with excitement making it easier for you to overcome friction and feel excited to do the tough tasks br br second lesson is to keep overall dopamine baseline level constant don t indulge too much in frivolous activities that give you a dopamine spike dopamine spikes exhaust and deplete dopamine production because at a time there is only so much dopamine your body can produce br hence you will not get dopamine high for other necessary activities as dopamine production capacity is exhausted and depleted in body you feel demotivated to do important tasks as your body is now not able to produce more dopamine for you to get started br br formula of success don t waste dopamine in mindless entertainment but keep it reserved for linking friction and stress with excitement and enthusiasm if you can make this a habbit all stressful tasks will then start appearing exciting
 how to release dopamine when friction arises
 main antagonist of dopamine is ur expectations on people n on situations when their is no expectation in ur brain u dont need dopamine free state of mind is itself dopamine
 i now understand why i work just to work thanks for the incredibly deep insight
 wow i m currently doing a bachelors in psychology at uni and i feel like i ve just sat down for a zoom lecture with a top quality professor very good and very appreciated lt
 watch robert saplosky s lecture on dopamine he has a couple lectues on dopamine but anticipation is the key outstanding lecture please give this lecture your time
 elizabethmolnar thank you will do
 they teach you outdated and useless information in colleges nowadays they also indoctrinate you on beliefs not based in fact aka wokeism its better to save your time and money and not go to college college kids that are indoctrinated are causing the destruction of our society and values
 stevenbalogh not sure if its exactly the same scenario in england where i go to uni plus every individual has the capability to think for themselves and decide what to agree and disagree with like aristotle said a good mind can analyse books information without being consumed by it most things arent as white or black as they may seem even wokeism
 iifridgeii most of the population doesnt have what aristotle described that s what the elites take advantage of
 i immediately start to focus on my work and goals the second i see and hear this guy
 this content exemplifies insightful depth a book i read with related themes offered life affirming insights quot a life unplugged reclaiming reality in a digital age quot by theodore blaze
 thank you for explaining really helpful have you talked about dopamine in women over who are menopausal or post would these all make a difference
 thank you professor andrew
 cold water therapy effects on dopamine adrenaline and nor adrenalin br dopamine can be released in ways local release and volumetric release br how pleasurable or satisfying you feel doesn t depend on peak level of dopamine it depends upon difference in baseline level and peak level of dopamine how you feel depends upon your previous level of dopamine as compared to present level many drugs just increase both baseline level and peak level instead of increasing the difference between them a big dopamine release makes it more challenging to achieve higher dopamine release the next time there should not be high level nor low level of dpamine for long br just increasing dopamine level will make us excited but that excitement will be for very less period of time br chocolate increases dipamine times but it goes away in few seconds desire of sex or act of sex increases dopamine times br nicotene smoked increases dopamine times above base line very short lived br amphetamine cocaine nicotine sex increases dopamine in everybody that takes them exercise hard work and studying increasea dopamine but it is subjective br after achieving something dopamine increases but after some time it falls down it falls down even below the baseline the extent it drops below the baseline is directly proportional to how high the peak was after achieving something if you feel preety happy the dopamine will not fall that much but if you feel extremely happy your dopamine will fall extremely after a day or two eg postpartum depression anyway we return to the baseline after some time br if we continue to engage in something exciting regularly after sometime it will be less exciting to us br some people release dopamine at higher level after a certain activity which deplete the releasable pool of dopamine so after sometime dopamine falls below base level and it leads to a low feeling some people do the dopamine spiking activity again and again to bring back dopamine up to experience pleasure again since they are feeling low but as we know they have depleted the stock of releasable dopamine the baseline begins to lower again and again this is called addiction and addicted people don t feel pleasure at all br addiction is the progressive narrowing of things that bring you pleasure if i am addicted to video games i will feel happy in only playing it i will not feel happy in exercise study social activity and my life will be ruined after a some time my system will stop releasing dopamine even after playing video games and nothing is left for me which can increase my dopamine this is the start of depression spiking dopamine again and again is the main cause of decline in the baseline level br if you experience a win whether it is school sports or relationship be highly careful about allowing yourself to experience a huge peak of dopamine br you kind of like exercise and to do exercise you increase dopamine by drinking energy drink and listen music to do exercise then you are increasing the number of conditions required to achieve the high level of dopamine by doing exercise don t use stimulants everytime you study or everytime you workout or anything in which you want to enjoy the process taking these stimulants music energy drinks motivational reels before the task will reduce the level of enjoyment and undermine the ability to stay motivated the best way is to get excitement and motivation from the task itself whether it is study or workout so enjoy the process only br some healthy ways to increase dopamine so that the base level is maintained cold water therapy which increases adrenalin and nor adrenalin rapidly while dopamine shows gradual increase to times above baseline and comes back to normal in hours here there is a sustained increase instead of rise and crash br if you work hard for the end result then the process will become very challenging
 wow
 this is probably the best podcast episode on planet earth thank you andrew
 im suffering from schizophrenia and depression for years ago its really difficult how to deal with this thing when u feel lost because of your medicine and get rid from anything that make u feel disconnected with your reality

 dr huberman s technique quot avoid dopamine highs quot look like it is working for me i stopped watching porn even though i never do it beyond hours per session and per day which i believe is not too much i suspected that it still probably made me sick so i wanted to see what happens if i stop it after just days of stopping it there is a small but recognizable difference in my mood first i felt better about myself and my self control and then noticed a tiny spike in motivation to go and change my life i will continue it and post results
 i have been misliving my whole years thank you andrew so grateful to meet you late is better than never
 wowwww this is so interesting no wonder i feel so depleted of energy and unmotivated i also have never heard addiction talked about in this way mind blown
 i recently noticed that i don t have the laser focus i do have while studying anymore and i needed to know why then i went on to google and i was directed here thank you so much
 thank you this was really informative and helpful
 andrew is literally saving lives with this information thank you so much for sharing with us and thank you for this podcast
 i am literally in tears now thank you very much andrew
 it would be very cool if andrew could bring on david wolfe to discuss the significance of detoxing ourselves parasites superfoods and so on
 my dopamine was released when you said that validation of previous beliefs evokes the release of dopamine now i have a scientific excuse to be the i told you so friend
 i wish all these information were available years ago br my life would have been much easier br thanks a lot
 what a great podcast
 being a musician and needing to quot access quot my dopamine quot as and when quot i need to this podcast was a brilliant addition seems to be the same as mastering your quot work rest quot cycles equilibrium brilliant work so detailed
 amazing job bro gave me so much clarity
 once you mastered the dopamine management you mastered your life
 the idea of layering dopamine is everywhere in my life from cooking with music to playing video games with other shit in the background to jamming out in workouts gonna try to limit a little bit and see where i go

 please everyone here share this to your nearest friends and family members now i am realising the importance of how much we are going to destroy our brain especially those who are young
 ive been on a personal crusade for a long time to contextualize the issues i face with adhd and other aspects of my life this one video has x my resolution on those issues its like i was almost there i had a working theory but now i have data thank you very much for this information ah
 relatable as hell godspeed sir
 what theboon said
 relatable
 people with adhd have a lower baseline to begin with does that mean they get to collect more dopamine on regular basis without spiking i m curious about fellow adhd s take on this

 turning your dopamine for ongoing motivation is a life changer for me
 thanks mate got alot out of your session
 one of the best informative podcast really thank
 thank you so much for providing all of this info
 you won me over i m rolling a dice for randomising dopamine decisions for the rest of my life
 in a few days huberman lab podcast has become my favorite podcast of all time damn this is incredible and his script is superb
 alr i didnt hear this kind of wisdom long time ago god bless andrew i ll try this
 very interestingly written it was easy and fun to read
 i like the way you describe how hard work release dopamin
 key takeaways for quick navigation br br
 thanks
 wow im so happy i found your channel br br same many wonderful information thank you
 thank you dr huberman team sponsors and supporters br there wasnt anything wrong with me there was something wrong with the approach i was taking sitting with that for a bit br br so happy for that young man the human is a brilliant organism br br i love that you were able to advocate for your health and that the doctor followed your instructions br br episode million subscribers
 suggested topic can you do a podcast on or address within a broader topic how to make yourself love or care about something for example many of us work a job we don t particularly love simply to pay the bills but we d perform much better if we only we could learn to love it or develop some degree of enjoyment of it over time is this possible if so how

 thank you andrew for impacting and improving civilisation through science and exploration
 thanks so much for this video it has helped me tremendously
 very useful video i learnt one thing that you can control your body when you understand how it works
 i have adhd and i watched this all the way through most of the time fully concentrated remakrably interesting informative and well put video thanks i ll be watching more of your content
 are you on meds
 how do you know you have adhd
 hyperfocus by interesting topics and or activities are very common for someone with adhd
 desertcentipede diagnosed many times since i was like
 phettywappharmaceuticalsll used to be on aradix gave it up bc it gave me night terrors
 tsyf nah i mean i one should know that they have adhd
 i also have adhd diagnosed at which was in it was my school that pushed my parents to look into it further as theyd never heard of it got to and lost focus was on ritalin from lately my concentration focus amp memory has probably been the worst its ever been unless i m doing he physical activity like a sport just seems i can t put my head to anything else never been able to read more than a few lines in a text
 lockwood most of the time i lose focus before the video has properly started you re doing good brother i can relate to the sports thing actually
 thomskatefb thanks bro nice to know i m not alone
 he did also a video for people that has adhd with solutions this video is more for neurotypical imho
 ranieromaximino i went on to watch many more episodes including that one they truly have helped me a lot to get closer to my goals
 i have never been diagnosed but pretty certain i have adhd haha i just dont see any benefits of getting diagnosed now
 bought the book the molecule of more thank you again making this information more accessible
 what an incredible lecture
 dr hhuberman thankyou for this presentation the documentary movie quot my octopus teacher quot involved the depressed filmmaker who swam in cold water without a wetsuit by the end of the film the depressed person s mood lifted he initially connected with the octopus then he began swimming with his son then he began collaborating with other fil m makers then he became committed to habitat preservation the behavioral activation combined with dopamine release seemed to be helpful here in addition connection and purpose counteract the existential emptiness associated with depression thank god coffee plays a helpful role
 i think that videogames made me addicted to dopamine now that i don t play as much i find my dopamine hits from physical activity br br while playing i was excited but after a while it transformed into a soft depression with physical activity i don t have this problem anymore i also can play here and there without feeling the urge to do that
 this video is a true gem
 wow this is the best experience i ve had of trying to understand some in depth science my mind usually cannot keep up with jargon and complex systems etc but this was explained at an incredible level for the average joe like me thank you so much i can t believe i didn t know any of this i ve been doing everything wrong haha i have been addicted to many things and thought my addiction to exercise was ok as it s been better than my previous addictions but even that has been failing recently now i get it i suffer from fibromyalgia and really struggle with pain and energy so i am so excited to have some new tools to try and regain some energy and stability with this new understanding seriously thank you technology fast starts tomorrow and i will be doing one thing at a time i m getting a dopamine rush just thinking about the potential success haha many blessings and thank you for all the effort this must have taken
 dr huberman is doing god s work thank you so much
 can we say that doing things which we enjoy doing gives us dopamine peak while doing the hard things and gradually start to get dopamine from it actually increases our dopamine baseline br which will be wonderful br is that the right interpretation
 very good explanation about addiction with the vesicles tha depleats clear to understand
 this changed my life thank you so much i ve been up and down for as long as i can remember
 tk you for sharing such knowledge it is very important to know and understand ourselves
 knowledge of knowledge i cant help but think that im learning how to be a better human having listened to everything this generous articulate and knowledgeable man gives us thank you so much dr huberman for sharing this knowledge with us you are an exemplary human being
 thanks so much doc just amazing
 best podcast ever hands down
 this is exactly what i needed as years old
 i have tourettes and i recently read that it essentially means that the dopamine receptors in my brain are more sensitive i am really curious on what effect that has on the way that i manage my dopamine levels it is really difficult to find information on tourettes in a language that i can actually understand and i really had to study even to find out what i have learned so far
 i have been diagnosed with tics which is essentially the little brother of tourettes i was also diagnosed with ocd and adhd the person who diagnosed me told me it is not uncommon for these three to be diagnosed together and also that it is extremely likely i have at least one relative with at least one of these conditions as well br br anyway i have learned that tics are associated with low dopamine so is adhd and ocd is often associated with unusual swings in dopamine i personally suspect i also have undiagnosed autism spectrum disorder back when i was diagnosed it was believed that you couldnt have both asd and adhd so they didnt even check but it is now known not only that you can have both but there is even a lot of overlap between the conditions from what i am learning asd is associated with low folate and folate is needed to create dopamine so low folate can easily contribute to low dopamine thats the neurochemical side i am still experimenting with finding the right solution but i am discovering that ensuring my diet has enough folate and magnesium is important i started using mucuna puriens extract to help with my dopamine and it helped but it was too much and caused a ton of intense migraines i now have been prescribed modafinil for my sleep problems which is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor and that seems to help more but good luck finding a doctor that will prescribe it i do worry long term that i may get used to it and it wont work and it still isnt an automatic cure all but it does help br br however specifically for tourettes tics another great thing to try is tre trauma release exercises basically sometimes why a person experiences something like tourettes is because the body has a bunch of stored up trauma and the tourettes is just some of that trauma spilling over tre is a great natural way to let it heal it or if you prefer you can also release it through cupping massage acupuncture hypnosis etc the quality of practitioners in all of these fields varies greatly so i recommend trying multiple people to see if they give you any relief all of these probably partly operate on the dopamine principles presented here br br i know that isnt a perfect cure but hopefully that gives you at least one new tool to try
 hollybigelow oh i m not looking to remedy it mine is very manageable i am very fortunate in that my tics are quite specific they kind of involve my whole upper body so if i m doing anything it kind of prevents the triggers i feel the urges but can wait until later in the day when i m ready to release when i m extremely stressed or excited they are harder to control but i don t have a problem with them br br i don t have any comorbidities with it either so again i ve been quite fortunate in that as well i ve also heard that cbt is a great way to treat tics and a lot of other traditional therapeutic techniques can be utilized for tourettes
 when you mention not to increase dopamine prior to the effort i find myself wondering if that applies to a situation of taking preworkout before a gym session i go in the mornings or right after work and the preworkout helps give me the boost of going and getting a good lift would you suggest skipping the preworkout
 wow what we traditionally refer to as the highs and lows of everyday life and the why of the swinging feelings explained scientifically dr huberman you are a gem to our generation i love your podcasts thank you very much
 great extrapolation of this presentation

 thank you it was a b t e r i f i c b br br what i would love as it s a video it s sketches diagrams etc it s sometimes quite complex to understand imagine the mechanisms
 key takeaways for quick navigation br br
 hi thank you thank you thank you for all of the mind blowing information i have a question and a request br br if someone doesn t care for chocolate do they still get the dopamine bump br br would you please do an episode on how chronic cannabis use affects dopamine and the body in general i feel like if i understood that it might help me change my relationship with it br br thank you again so much i also appreciated your episode on ketamine i ve been a patient for almost years now and it totally turned my life around saved it best thing i ever did for myself
 hi andrew my brother is flying in and staying with me after a relapse and failed suicide attempt i m trying to learn as much as i can about this dopamine science so i can be the most supportive person in his life and try to help him get control of his life and brain the article you included is blocked for organization use only is there a way you could get the public access to it thank you from a worried brother
 i subscribed in the first minutes i absolutely love this literature backed combination of physiology and psychology bloody brilliant thank you and i look forward to seeing more
 i am health coach this was very good i only take supplements with an nsf certification
 this lecture is really comprehensive and valuable but misses something very essential for learning and that is illustrative materials
 what stood out to me and what i had no clue was dopamine being a connector for parkinsons and louis body dementia and the statement quot being treated properly quot br br my dad who turned recently has parkinsons and loius body dementia and worse yet he lives in the shit state of florida where the quot medical care quot is laughable poor and careless br and i can tell you he has not been treated properly he is tired all the time no energy to do anything and it takes months between doctors appointments for them to see him and barely do anything the quot medical quot groups in fl are sickening florida is literally a place for the elderly to go to pass because the medical field there sure as hell doesn t care or try hard enough to keep people living br it s just more sick corruption of that quot cuntry quot making people pay for insurance instead of having universal healthcare like most other countries and it clearly works but the states don t want to do that because they want to just steal as much money as they can making people pay for something that they still have to pay for treatments for what quot insurance doesn t cover quot and most people still can t even afford other treatments so in turn people die as if it s a punishment for not having enough money to give to the evil greedy corrupt government
 anyone elses dopamine going off during the entire episode thank you andrew

 dropping knolwedge as always i myself am addicted to dopamine intace by various sources and im struggling to overcome it this really comes in the right moment for me great work
 i need more of this
 only you dr andrew can make listening to talk of neurotransmitters neuroreceptors sexy br bringing sexy back
 i have parkinson s it s bad it seems like dopamine is two different things or much more thank you very much for the info it helps
 it s a decently minor thing but of the people who injected mptp did get cured it required neural grafts from fetal tissue which were performed in lund sweden
 hi andrew this is probably far fetched but what do you think about nefiracetam and its effect on dopamine
 i m a year old adhd patient who has been on a long difficult journey this is the type of information that i wish i had when i was first diagnosed i m implementing the dopamine fast and i ll report back how it goes thank you
 how is your dopamine fast is going bro
 i am late discovering this podcast but hope mr huberman can answer a couple of questions for me in response to this very informative video br lab studies show gingko biloba s terpenoids improves blood circulation which is why it may help with cognitive function memory benefits eye health and cardiovascular function there are also rat studies that have shown reduced serum prolactin levels and increased dopamine levels in the hypothalamus area of the brain so theoretically would this supplement boost dopamine enough to deplete it below baseline levels after daily use at recommended dose of mg of a leaf extract times day br in regards to exogenous melatonin supplementation reducing baseline levels of dopamine would that also apply to natural production of melatonin from red light wavelengths from the sun and red light therapy
 thank you for your interest in dopemine science br br lesson learned from this masterclass be boring to preserve your dopamine
 hey neuroscience lovers what neuromodulators and transmitters are needed for selfcontrol and discipline how to hack the selfdistraction patterns and how would you explain it with our bodies chemicals br love to read the links you watched or read love to hear from your own experiences
 i wonder what happens to your motivation and dopamine level when you have negative and positive drives working at the same time for example i have worn out my hamstring so there is a constant but annoying pain when sitting down and working even though i love certain aspects of my work but i have found the thought of sitting down and working associated with pain after a period of time you can t stand and work throughout the day so this is a bit of a paradox
 super lecture so much practical information thanx

 how does refraining from a certain activity for days to reset dopamine levels work with multiple addictions activities if i had a opiate addiction and try to stop vaping nicotine smoking weed or even quit using social media would the dopamine levels actually reset hopefully this makes since thank you so much in advance
 while some of this is common sense there was also a lot of unique insight because you didnt dumb this down thank you
 thanks its motivating to us all
 i d love to see you host dr joe dispenza and talk about the intersections of neuroscience quantum physics and epigenetics
 thank you for the this amazing information i took so many note and i will apply this information to my life
 what a great podcast i can emphasize how important watching some of this episodes has been to me
 incredible andrew thank you

 who would have thought there could be better podcasts than rogan incredible podcast with dr noam sobel
 this is really great content and i appreciate it very much br br however one thing confuses me br br in terms of dopamine and dopamine peak exercise positive thing is similar to some toxic substances x baseline and positive impact of exercise is related to some other consequences not related to dopamine in compare with toxic substances br br so exercise is something which can also be negative in terms of dopamine because we receive peak and because of this we need to be careful with combining exercise with some other dopamine increasing acitivity reward br br did i understand well that exercise in terms of dopamine is similar to some toxic substances acitivity or there is something else which i missed
 missed
 amazing video very helpful very intelligent man i have one question though how can you reduce dopamine experienced if you play a game of football and you just absolutely love it
 this is incredibly fascinating and fantastically produced amazing series we are so lucky and privileged to have access to this world class standard of information and teaching available to us
 yes
 what happens if you tell yourself that if you finish episode of your favorite show or channel you get to work memorize build and or develop what you want to be focused on
 i would like to check in within a year to compare im at that phase now i used to be a highly motivated individual i ate healthy exercised regularly and excelled at my studies i can also recall being a lot more romantically involved with the wife but for the past months have been really hard i struggle to exercise and study it feels like im drowning in stress and distraction im not even interested in being romantic with the wife i dont know why i went to see a phycologist but because i was not suicidal i was not taken serious went to my doctor but he gave me quot anti stress quot pills it did not help do i stress about work yes do i stress about my income and financial obligations yes do i stress about the political environment and my families future yes but these used to motivate me to study harder to get out of the situation motivation to exercise harder to relieve the stress but my motive drive an energy is just gone and i don t know why could it be just dopamine i anyway dont do facebook tik tok twitter etc wish me luck
 never found more acknowledging thing on yt than this one its absolutely life changing
 this has got to be the most helpful modern day knowledge
 thank you you may have saved my future and the way i look at work
 you ve taken all of the fragmented and isolated information i ve been trying to get to grips with for a few years now brought it all together in a single cohesive and understandable form that i m finally able to sit back and get an understanding of br br i m desperately in the middle of applying myself to all of this and having it delivered to me in the way you ve packaged it has been absolutely crucial whether i succeed or fail this video will have solely given me the push i ve needed to give it yet one more try br br thank you kindly sir good luck to us all
 this i knew i was on to something when i made a connection between releasing massive amounts of dopamine and feeling horrible mentally
 may you be successful in your endeavors amen
 same godspeed
 love to hear something about dopamine etc etc connection with gaming regardless of game style time spend late nights playing stress levels peaks amp lows please tell me someone is doing this research
 so i watched this podcast about three times and have written a summary of words but here i m going to write out practical for me thesises with no theory or explanation not sure it ll be useful to somebody but it s at least a comment to support andrew s channel br br don t have huge peaks of dopamine often they should be intermittent and random flip a coin br don t waste your dopamine because it s the single currency quit palatable food br don t layer multiple sources of dopamine music smartphone br cold exposure br enjoy the tension don t work for a reward a samurai doesn t have a goal only a path br be sure what you are doing is good for you placebo br avoid light exposure at night br social connections
 how do i ensure that there is no trigger ability that lowered the dopamine below the baseline for example when starting to search for job applying online and etc i can immediately senses my dopamine got lowered and i feel like whining depressed or whatever that type of feeling when i want distraction and other mindless direction and that s probably because it interpret as the need for dopamine release
 i had never heard of yerba mate but i absolutely love their soda it literally made me feel better
 such a performance i really learned and excited
 listening till the very end of this hours podcast just out of interest in neuroscience itself is a dopamine release through efforts i can literally feel the release of dopamine at the end of this podcast
 perhaps a discussion around the subjectivity of dopamine and how malleable that could be thinking perhaps with stoic philosophy principles maybe a discussion with ryan holiday although i m not sure how much more content there would be from this
 hi thanks a lot for the video it was interesting and informative
 thank you for the help sir
 incredible video fantastic stuff
 i have severe adhd and back in the day when i have no idea of adhd if i want to focus and study i used to skip meals specially dinner and my focus was dramatically improved i don t know if it is related to what dr huberman is saying but i always wonder why not eating incerase my focus
 this podcast was so powerful and engaging as someone with adhd this is information i have been sorely needing for a long while thank you
 yeah when he talked abt mppp and the symptoms of mptp i could relate to my overall condition far from boxed in but constant weeklong brainfog and pressure in one s head feels not nice either imo
 hyphenpointhyphen my dude i m sorry that is happening to you it is so frustrating and intrusive and just yeah i feel you and feel for you br br i hope you are being looked after and have the care you need if you ever want any trial and error information on dealing with intense brain fog i m happy to share as for the quot it feels like someone attached a bicycle pump to my skull quot feeling the only thing i got is rinse out your sinuses with saline every day and tie a tight bandana or headband around your head and drink plenty of caffeine and water the sinus rinse only helps relieve a bit of the pressure but the headband and caffeine help restrict the blood flow which helps relieve much more of the pressure not telling you what to do or anything i just hate seeing people in pain br br best wishes to you
 i don t think this particular discussion is necessarily the right advice for adhd it s common psychotheraputic advice in adhd to couple quot difficult tasks quot or quot boring tasks quot to rewards he is advising against that but presumably for neurotypical brains br br i think perhaps if you re adhd symptoms are managed and medicated enough to be able to make task completion itself the reward then great but i suspect having adhd means that most of us will need to use the quot reward strategy quot to help build healthier productive routines and cure our chronic procrastination
 ems how long have you taken adhd medication for
 would a dysregulation of dopamine or low dopamine sensitivity also contribute to a mental state of depersonalization feeling emotionally numb as if the person is not controlling his or her words and actions and feeling detached from ordinary sensations such as touch thirst hunger and libido hope to hear from anyone with some insights into this thank you
 i forgot we have technology such as chatgpt now however i would interested if anyone could confirm the answer chatgpt has given me br some theories propose that depersonalization may be associated with changes in dopamine functioning for example there is evidence to suggest that alterations in the dopamine system may lead to disturbances in self awareness and bodily perception which could contribute to depersonalization experiences additionally certain psychiatric conditions associated with depersonalization such as schizophrenia have been linked to dysregulation of dopamine transmission
 pure gold thanks
 so would thinking about how good of a shape youll be and how much better your life will be because of count as thinking about the reward at the end or would that be enjoying the process
 thank you for the awesome very helpful information
 would like comments on the dopamine effect of sugary soft drinks the mechanism of the instant gratification that they provide and the additive behavior created for those drinks the base premise of the presentation is that feeling good is a primary and good goal for people to have that in fact is a fundamental problem david goggins for example does not approach what he does to feel good in fact he says that great power is accomplished through suffering perhaps you can comment on that
 i m not exaggerating when i say this this video will change my life forever and i will never be able to thank you enough for it
 how is it going
 if cold water increases dopamine times even with this lasting up to three hours won t we experience a drop below baseline after the effect wears off can t that be harmful in the long run
 this explains so much to me as a combat veteran see why most vets become addicts infantry guys anyways its easy for me to get addicted to things im addicted to the alpha male military mindset after the military i seek life death things for happiness like skydiving and base jumping mma but where is the line between addict dopamine junkie vs personality and as a martial artest too im big on discipline so what might call discipline focus someone elese will say it addictive mindset
 i thought i just needed to accept jesus now all this stuff huberman goes on for infinity with all the super important vital critical things i need to do and buy i already maxed out my credit buying all the products he told me to buy i think i could have saved money by just enrolling at stanford in a phd program
 so if i understand this correctly the levels of dopa someone has relative to their base line affects the level of pleasure one experiences during that event am i correct in thinking that similar events in the future will not produce feelings of reward because of how that event was colored by its dopamine level in the past even if that event is pleasurable by its very nature
 you suggested that we need to consciously monitor our dopamine level sounds a lot like meditation do you think that meditation and process of being totally attentive while working which is a form of meditation where thought is absent can help in bringing the baseline of dopamine
 cold showers foraging addiction gold stars growth mindset the rewarding properties of deprivationthis is so powerful thanks so much
 great video andrew i love it
 man i am so glad that i watched the highly scientific documentery crank with the neuroscientist jason statham
 thank you for this treasure of informations

 thanks very helpful information
 firstly happy belated birthday dr huberman all the best wishes to you and secondly thank you so much for this episode i m an electrical engineer but i m in love with your podcasts on neuroscience they help me tremendously in dealing with my anxiety which rose steeply during this whole isolation period especially helpful was to learn about taqi kynan in your podcast which was a eureka moment for me thank you
 respect for you man
 thanks a lot for this detailed explanation
 i suffer from avolition since i live alone at im paralysed in action even small things like getting dressed or cook or go out shopping or wash dishes i have to fight for each effort its painful but as soon as i am in company with someone else i am full of energy and proactive the problem is im socially isolated and cannot find people to hang out with even on dating apps br my uncle and cousins have the same symptoms in worse with schizophrenia i dont but only this negative symptom and it dont seem to have solution here in france
 i hope you feel better sorry youre feeling lonely
 i don t know if i have the motivation to listen to a hour podcast about motivation and focus but i ll try
 this man is a legend
 your work is at an incredibly profound impact on a very difficult part of my life i don t know how much progress i d have made without your research being so accessible
 did you know that andrew has published books quot the neuroscience of dopamine detox neuromastery lab quot and quot the neuroscience of morning routine neuromastery lab quot i am listening to andrew like for years and just recently discovered that he has published books as well
 everything i needed to know about dopamine thanks
 hii guys i didnt speak english because im from india but when i see andrew sir i think it was very excellent sir
 i love you christine after that night with you my dopamine levels reached maximum level i need you to please come back and let me rehabilitate from a depleted and erased dopanime base line
 very helpful information thank you
 i have been looking for a podcast like this for a long time the perfect amount of depth plenty of science and plenty of practical application masterfully taught bless you this information is great for us adhd people trying to figure out how to optimize our dopamine situation
 great stuff cold showers excellent stuff baseline dopamine info also very informative
 focus on the progress activity itself what do i like about exercise studying working not the end goal br br indulging in pleasurable activities will raise dopamine but then it will cause a drop that goes below the baseline and it takes a while for it to go back to the normal baseline br br intermittent schedules of dopamine release br br in order to keep baseline when indulging in pleasurable activities don t always search the highest pleasure sometimes no pleasure sometimes a bit of pleasure and sometimes a little more extremely high levels of dopamine will always cause the decrease in baseline that will take some time to recover br br if activity is very pleasurable make sure it doesn t happen often br if an activity happens often make sure to implement intermittent schedules of dopamine br br don t reward yourself for a hard task yet just appreciate the journey and the effort the reward increases dopamine further which makes the effort feel less pleasurable in comparison and will deter you from pursuing those good activities in the future
 i m curious br if getting an reward after an activity diminishes enjoyment during activity why is it that dogs are trained using treat as rewards but the behavior tricks can sustain without the treat after a while
 remarkable piece of information
 greetings from egypt many thanks for all the provided information really helpful
 i absolutely love your podcasts i have watched many so informative your passion for science and drive to share your knowledge are commendable i don t want to sound negative because your podcasts are fantastic but i want to make a point for a layman regular person could you make another set of podcasts where you summarize the content in minutes or less some people love science and biology and then there maybe people like me who want you to get to the final point i can spare minutes to listen to your awesome podcast please make a shorter version for us thank you dr huberman
 what can i do during the troughs when i have zero motivation to do anything whatsoever i find in these moments that i can t even fall asleep so is there anything i can do thats best for my baseline dopamine long term in those moments
 i have one question is it fine to do another task you don t like after another task you don t like such as studying and then after working out
 in regards to your story about how you had giardia treated with thorazine which you said blocks dopamine receptors how did the l dopa help if the receptors were blocked
 brilliant content and delivery
 thank you for sharing this knowledge
 when history looks back on this time mr huberman you will be one of the names that changed the way people see the world thank you for your contribution to this world your reach and inspiration reaches so much further than you will ever know
 he s easily one of the most important podcasts out there helpful info no bs and incredibly professional credible
 that s why he needs to write his book nobody knows if youtube will still be around in the future a book or many that would be his legacy
 naw i agree with petsem dude honestly a lot of podcasters are important and incredibly influencial in society today and really that translates to influencing societies trends towards changing in this way or that way podcasting is still kind of new seeming to most people as a media platform but overall its super powerful cuts through bullshit that shorter more adhd ish traditional media like television doesnt which is usually owned by some big corperation with their own goals in mind other than educating or sharing information etc anyway you can change the fucking world with your iphone using a fucking podcast nowadays
 dude calm down yes he does great episodes summarizing scientific papers and other work but thats all he does and he certainly wont go down in history by summarizing information lmao
 youtubedestroyedmylife br br give me an example where someone changed the world with an iphone br except steve jobs obviously
 huberman is only nd to mr jacque fresco
 ahhalla explain
 careful this comment might spike up his dopamine and potentially reduce his baseline
 he could start a religion
 namoratnemra touche hahah
 google saves everything in their hard drives right now
 no he won t this is nothing new at all he s simply putting it into scientific language and reducing things down to a neuro chemical biological paradigm which strips real world action of much of it s lived meaning
 theloniusmonk how
 elliot and the the m
 rofl
 surfbum i wrote you a long answer but youtube seems to have removed it how strange
 phamawa u
 agree every episode of huberman lab is mind blowing
 zen buddhists have known all of this for thousands of years it s nothing new
 i deeply agree with this
 yes no doubt all this information and for free he is true champion
 the world isnt changing youre just staring into a self help echochamber
 well said my friend
 josephpalmer no it doesn t einstein try again
 ghostwriter them s fighting words lol
 arnwadz de m
 arnwadz he is a doctor this is just his podcast i m sure he enjoys doing this it s apparent however i don t think he paid for and attended med school to be able to do these podcasts he s still young he s got a few books in him yet i m sure many blessings of abundance love and light
 glad i saw this i was an addict for years years clean now i was and am a dopamine junky what he is saying yall is so on point and needs to be implemented in all rehabilitation facilities
 infinite blessings amen
 i was thinking the same thing
 jjdemaio and they were correct and i believe it but there was just no science to back anything up
 arnwadz aaaa
 oh yeah no
 oh
 wow great quote thank you
 i believe you are right but just a small criticism he has a phd so he should be referred to as dr huberman
 well said
 so i m in australia i love your content i m not a scientist but the way you explain it allows me to participate in your communication around science and ophthalmology i listen to you every week most other days and love everything you talk about please know that you do you have an audience over here and sometimes those specials that you give perhaps you could find an australian supplier to provide them
 i have had cancer twice once in that took a year for me to get over and then in i was diagnosed with leukaemia a pml that also took another year to get over so now i spend my time researching watching information watching your podcast watching mini people that you interview in fact david sinclair and watch tom bilyeu i watch dr daniel amen rhonda parker love them all
 hell yea well said my friend
 who needs a time machine
 ghostwriter more like dr joe dispenza they should both do a collabo

 he is a professor basic rule in academia publish or perish
 he inspired me to get a degree in neuroscience
 the fuck is wrong with you people you can look up everything he s saying extremely easily how do you think he knows all this stuff uhh oh yea he read a fucking book
 hes changed the way i see life
 absolutely sending light and love to everyone here and gratitude to andrew huberman for his big beautiful heart
 truth
 chill
 truth
 arnwadz a little overblown he s kind for spending extra time beyond the classroom and the demands on his research time to do these podcasts but you should realize that he s just showing you the kind of thoughtful work that academics of all varieties do for a lifetime
 if this comment doesn t increase the dopamine of mr huberman nothing will
 phamawa q
 incredible information
 arnwadz like bookstores have been growing and youtube has been shrinking buddy your slow
 youtubedestroyedmylife z
 it s not that deep dog he also pushes a lot of products that don t work or that he don t even use so he s not exactly that great of a guy

 really great thanks for all of this
 i have an excitement for your videos and hearing your voice seems to make me excited to learn
 i am a year old female i was diagnosed with parkinson s disease in july my complaint of small writing got my family doctor s attention i have stiffness and balance issues i went to two different neurologists who had no information on something else other than sinemet its side effects compared to benefits are not worth taking i am researching and embracing vitamins and minerals that and movement balance pt has improved my quality of life not much info out there on dopamine and parkinson s depletion of dopamine your info has given me a direction for research thank you for this and other podcasts your examples are relevant and easy to understand brilliant
 thank you for this very useful video
 professors andrew great man
 i d kill to hear an episode from you on spatial processing and memory or perhaps memory in general incredible podcast overall dr huberman thank you
 me too please
 that s a great idea hopefully he reads this
 thanks for the vidya knowledge daana donating for free for lack of a better word to describe charity or alms br my thanks to you is my gurudakshina guruji

 well you only need the light when it s burning low br only miss the sun when it starts to snow br only know you love her when you let her go br br only know you ve been high when you re feeling low br only hate the road when you re missing home br only know you love her when you let her go br br and you let her go br br staring at the bottom of your glass br hoping one day you ll make a dream last br but dreams come slow and they go so fast br br you see her when you close your eyes br maybe one day you ll understand why br everything you touch surely dies br br but you only need the light when it s burning low br only miss the sun when it starts to snow br only know you love her when you let her go br only know you ve been high when you re feeling low br only hate the road when you re missing home br only know you love her when you let her go
 also it gave me a whole new view on letting my little one paly video games the whole day
 if you re taking cold showers and getting this elevated dopamine for up hours isn t that seriously depleting your dopamine reserves the whole quot depletion of readily reservable pool of dopamine vesicles quot idea
 man i have watched one episode of this podcast and it already had an impact on my life for the better i realized of so many mistakes that i was making thank you dr hubermann
 how listening to this podcast boosts dopamine is unfathomable


 thank you that was really interesting to learn
 excellent podcast
 my biggest takeaway is br find pleasure in effort train your mind to identify challenge as reward because it s a sustainable way to keep your base line dopamine level at a reasonable level and one you can mimic by engaging in overall productive behaviour like work or exercise also a cold shower can work wonders when in doubt
 i smiled so hard because this speaks to the things i already believe in and for the first time in a long time i took a max cold shower today after all warm showers for a long time and i felt amazing also i just discovered this man because of rhonda
 bout to watch this whole podcast in one sitting watch
 according to professor mustafa mahmoud an egyptian professor and philosopher quot a human being is the one who endures what they dislike and resists what they love quot
 this is the highest quality science based podcast in existence hands down this is the highest quality science based podcast in existence hands down
 hello dear huberman i watching this video and get interested about the content that how dopamine can lead a person to do or not do certain things br i appreciate your effort for free information and thank you for preparing access of these concept br actually we dont have persian content enough and i think if you dont mind i can translate the subtitle to farsi to use our farsi speaker but not sure for copywrite rulse in youtube we have permit to do that br please guide me how can i do that br thanks
 peace be upon u amp us thank you so much for this valuable video
 the program begins at
 you have saved my life on many days when i have been having a hard day your voice reason intelligence and humor have all made me feel better thank you for your guidance and your life s work you are a good human sending gratitude
 his voice totally

 why arent we being taught these things in school really makes you wonder what the system is meant to do to the mass
 so i am addicted to the internet and porn the more i allow myself to use these vices the more narrowed the lost if things i enjoy and find manageable to do are br br admittedly other options than the internet take time and must be done it takes some courage to decide to work on character to achieve those things which are healthier alternatives to self isolation and anxiety
 you could read the quot ithaca poem quot by kavafis it tells how the journey has more value and you have to enjoy it because it s more important than the goals ithaca
 so if you need an intermittent reward schedule but also are being rewarded by the work that you do doesn t that mean the work you re doing will lead to dopamine crashes like if you re working for that long and you find the work rewarding won t that deplete your releasable dopamine levels or can that be dealt with by taking breaks while you work thereby replenishing your dopamine levels or is it more like the work doesn t cause too high of a dopamine peak so you re good to go
 we live in a society
 i had always felt that drop after a high of accomplishing i could never understand it before this below baseline makes so much sense thank you
 amazing stuff thanks a ton
 that s great i can learn english and improve my knowledge about health at the same time thanks
 awesome information i beileve everyone should hear at least once
 cold exposure intermittent dopamine scheduling effort cultivating growth mindset
 can you do a future piece talking about l tyrosine and mucuna pruriens as compared with carbidopa levodopa for parkinsons
 im so glad andrew finally decided to talk about dopamine im tired of the misconceptions of it andrew thank you for the podcast and responding to my questions about sleep during winter on twitter youre positively changing peoples lives i hope you know this my man respectfully
 one thing you need to keep in mind is the way cocaine or meth effect a person for the first time using you get an information overload making you curious about how everything works especially those things more complex
 could listen to him all day
 this s just a personal note of mine as someone who s trying to adress my own sense of burnout so there s gonna be a bias of focus here a bit also warning but swear words incoming br br dopamine can be turnt into norepinephrine which turns into epinephrine adrenaline br br dopamine works in base lines and peaks and the state you are feeling is based on the discrepancy between the two br br a higher discrepancy leads to less reinforcement pleasure so to say br br the mezo cortical limbic system determines the amount of dopamine multiplier based on the subjective perception of enjoyment of said person br br basically this enables us to be able to have a growth mindset this lets us attach effort to enjoyment as opposed to attaching goals to enjoyment which makes it possible for one to experience burnout br br because burnout is the discrepancy between effort and reward br br also due to how dopamine works if you have a goal oriented mindset that means dopamine is released after the goal is achieved br br so your starting line already lacks the fucking hormone that makes your body fucking move then that can lead to associating that experience as having less dopamine rewards circling that back to your mezo cortical limbic system making you have to spike your dopamine even more with more fucking music more coffee more sex and so on
 is it something special about specifically water that makes cold bath shower effective for dopamine increase or can you get the same effect from just exposure to cold temperatures in general for example walking around in winter conditions wearing less clothing
 and wont you expend so much of your available dopamine after hours of times elevated dopamine levels following a cold bath that you inevitably end up with a massive crash
 i have so many questions br so it is better to not have music while exercise but if i really need to then i should have music randomly instead of having music every time i exercise is this correct br from what andrew said cold shower increase dopamine and that high level of dopamine stays high for hours but what about the dopamine crash is the crash after cold shower just as low and does it stays just as long br after a whole day of busy work or after playing sport i often go home feeling tired and low energy which i now understand it comes from dopamine crash thanks to this podcast and i usually watch tv shows to cheer myself up is this bad because my dopamine level is already low and depleted and watching tv shows which is an attempt to engage in dopamine seeking behaviors would not be good if this is the case after a long day from work or sport should i not doing any dopamine seeking behaviors like watching tv shows youtube scrolling instagram etc and i should just idk sit quiet and mediate or something
 this is hands down the most helpful video i have ever watched thank you dr huberman as a year old man as i look back at my life in the context of this knowledge i realize that much of my previous struggles with depression were likely the result of drugs alcohol and other dopamine spiking activities i m currently sharing this knowledge with my friends and adult children and am committed to better dopamine management for myself thank you thank you thank you
 exactly from y o man etc etc
 thank you very helpful wish i could share this with my subscribers
 what videos about dopamin are part of my dopamin kick seeing yt addition br ps interesting how often you mention gym in this video i think majority if interested viewer don t have a gym addiction
 the story starts from
 ill go even further saying that this video is the intro to unplugging from the matrix
 great information thanks
 i literally was talking about doing a deeper research on dopamine yesterday and this morning i woke up to this video thank you soooo much for always creating content that is so useful
 does fasting increase bdnf which will increase brain connections and improve concentration cognitive functions do you think is that correct bcz i want to try fasting just for increasing bdnf for your reply matters
 this has changed my life br thank you
 awesome and can you please have professor stuart mcgill on back pain
 tum bahut hi jyada intelligence ho i love your work i want to hire you bharat mata ki jai
 this is the most important video in youtube thankyou
 so what to do about the very long term decreases in dopamije from viewing bright lights between pm and am i suffer from this i believe
 thank you andrew i ve been depressed the past few months and what you have described in this video explains how i feel my dopamine levels have been wrecked over the past years from gaming and porn my gym work is suffering now because of it too this has been eye opening to me and id like to thank you for this free content i ve subbed and shared the video
 might seem difficult at the beginning until you find the right equation
 dopamine synthesis just finished your fascinating talk on dopamine and want to clarify there is a finite amount of dopamine in your system assuming you have all of the building blocks we are able to optimize how we use that dopa but cannot increase the actual amount thanks
 i like how you explain whenever you use unfamiliar terms
 the most important podcast i ever watched
 this is why having adhd is one of the worst things to have in life and people dont even believe it exists even though brain scans prove it
 this podcast is so great i wish i was taught science like this in school would ve been a better student

 bhagwat gita says br quot you only have the rights to your actions not to the fruits of your labor don t worry about your reward keep doing the actions without attachment to laziness quot
 mucuna pruriens is also sold in canada as a supplement
 i m a creative person never had an interest in the sciences until now i can t help but wonder what else i might be doing in life if i had teachers like this when i was growing up quot vomited out quot is that a technical term br br and pilot v s that s the only pen i ll use
 is there any study on the saddhu boards nail standing and dopamine levels i feel like the process awakens the same feelings as cold water exposure
 this information is more important and useful than of the stuff i learned in high school amazing how our school system does such a horrible job at preparing us for life
 the goal of the school system isn t to prepare people for life it s to prepare people to be good employable citizens mostly making going hrs a day days a week to the same place a normal thing to do desensitizing people to making them work like machines at least in my opinion br br if schools really had in mind how do we teach people to make the most of their lives and be happy the curriculum would look much different and it wouldn t run for hrs a day days a week you could learn more effectively in smaller chunks for less days
 amazing indeed
 building wealth involves developing good habits like regularly putting money away in intervals for solid investments instead of trying to predict and prognosticate the stability of the market and precisely when the change is going to happen a better strategy is simply having a portfolio thats well prepared for any eventually thats how some folks been averaging k every week these past months according to bloomberg
 investors should exercise caution with their exposure and exercise caution when considering new investments particularly during periods of inflation it is advisable to seek guidance from a professional or trusted advisor in order to navigate this recession and achieve potential high yields
 this is superb information as a noob it gets quite difficult to handle all of this and staying informed is a major cause how do you go about this are you a pro investor
 through closely monitoring the performance of my portfolio i have witnessed a remarkable growth of k in just the past two quarters this experience has shed light on why experienced traders are able to generate substantial returns even in lesser known markets it is safe to say that this bold decision has been one of the most impactful choices i have made recently
 wow thats stirring do you mind connecting me to your advisor please i desperately need one to diversified my portfolio
 ive actually been looking into advisors lately the news ive been seeing in the market hasnt been so encouraging whos the person guiding you
 the adviser i m in touch with is b nolan velden brent b he works with merrill pierce smith incorporated and interviewed on cnbc television you can use something else for me he strategy works hence my result he provides entry and exit point for the securities i focus on
 i just googled his name and his website came up right away it looks interesting so far i m going to book a call with him and let you know how it goes thanks
 wow this is superb i just googled his name and his website came up right away i just left him a message pray he replies soon
 thanks i really appreciate first i thought it was a bot but it s real i just googled his name and his website came up right away i just left him a message
 i think it s important to note that intermittent fasting is horrible for people who have a history of disordered eating of some kind reward from deprivation can become just as dangerous as reward from engaging in some activity
 very informational thank you

 love frm kashmir i found u via podcast of ranveeer allahbdia such a great content creator he is coz of fact that he many times gives reference of you
 this stuff that andrew is talkng about is very interesting im and im thinking if i will go to a university about neuroscience thank u for helping millions of students to learn about important stuff like that for free

 i m an ex cocain addict and i suppose just an addict in general i tended to stack it with every other dopamine releasing substance or activity you could imagine pretty regular use for maybe years i m curious if there are permanent effects from these types of addictions especially after such long periods of time
 long term cocaine use can result in psychosis glad you quit
 watch
 watching this video increased my dopamine times above baseline

 amazing video thank you
 doesnt this mean that adhd is treatable by not overin br dulging in dopamenergic activities
 thank you so much for this brilliant episode i can t even express how i was surprised by this content it challenged me to think through my all areas of my life and finally understood why my love life and even school isn t going very well you are a truly amazing professor
 i would love to see you do a podcast with andrew tate it would be interesting to hear your science and tate confirming serving as living proof his dopamine mindset and motion pathways are dialed in and optimized it s because he has mindset exactly as you described
 this is great but i still don t think i ll be working out without music quite yet haha
 books on dopamine as mentioned above dopamine nation and the molecule of more
 thank you doctor andrew
 great content
 thank you doc this podcast on dopamine came at the perfect time
 i have a gene mutation comt val val or gg that removes dopamine too fast and causes a lower level of dopamine in my prefrontal cortex i have tried taking wellbutrin cymbalta and effexor but they cause me anxiety attacks and muscle tension i also have the mthfr gene mutation i am trying to find the right supplements that my body can methylate and create balance how much would you recommend supplementing with macuna pruriens or l tyrosine on a regular basis or would you recommend cold water exposure daily
 i know this video is two years old but if you would share if someone was a chronic daily marijuana smoker for over years and decided to quit will their dopamine baseline ever return back to normal br br especially if they continue practicing mindfulness regarding what affect our high and low of dopamine
 thanks doc god bless u br br
 outstanding headings by huberman lab
 this knowledge of dopamine system is evoking dopamine release in me hope it increases my base line level dopamine not just peak
 i was always in to getting information about dopamine always been curious to dig deep dive into what dopamine is what it does pros cons etc here all my questions ended i got every possible question answered these hours spent here has to be my most significant ever huge respect for you sir from india
 hai andrew br in one of your previous video you said that brain works in the optimum mode if the autonomic nervous system is off but if i do intermittent fasting dont that autonomic nervous system affects my focus since i don t have the food in my stomach
 so interesting nevertheless ages behind yoga and chi gong which are as well mostly addictive present day quot masters quot refrrain from pointing the finger at this crirical point so many thanks
 withdrawals from caffeine make me so miserable that it makes me suicidal hint caffeine gets me totally euphoric when my tolerance is low
 would a relatively cocaine naive person maybe having taken it once experience a dopamine surge if they then b dreamed b about taking another hit
 amazing master class in dopamine
 i rarely write comments but this podcast is an inspiration and you dear doctor are doing an amazing job in spreading knowledge about very important aspects of life thank you for that
 you re amazing thank you
 i love how you explain thank you for enriching my life can i work for you
 thank you so much sir
 is this related to habit forming online and technology activities i heard about how video games can be habit forming is dopamine the root cause and if so then according to what i found online even socializing can impact our dopamine levels
 cold shower br enjoy the effort by choice and say love it rather than going after reward
 i rewatched the huberman interview that came out on impact theory a couple of times this past week because it was such important info i was even able to use it to start waking up at the time that i really wanted to so glad to see that this was the topic released today looking forward to digesting and sharing this info
 is it safe to say that the volumetric release of dopamine is correlated to the peaks and that the synaptic release is correlated to the baseline
 how do i know if my dopamine baseline is low and i need to fast or i need to do enjoyable things and be nice to myself i m struggling with this because if i feel bad i get the though should i force myself to stay in this position or should i do something enjoyable then after a time i think things like sitting still is not healthy so i will move but excersise creates dopamine so did i give up resetting my baseline br br when i feel bad i watch informative videos or listen to music or sing and that makes me feel good but after it and during it i think did i give up now the path to resetting my dopamine baseline i don t exactly think this but my thoughs is based on it br br but is fasting not bad when you do it to much because we need proteins for hour muscles in the short and long run fat for hour cells and keeping warm so how do you explain this
 dr huberman can you please discuss creatine and benefits for brain and cognitive function and benefits of creatine in general as well as side effects it seems like a very controversial topic nowadays were media and some scientific publications say its negative while most literature say its safe plz and thank you
 this was eye opening for me melatonin and blue light who would have thunk
 when the neurogilist says neurology really isn t that hard
 we love you dude you are a gift to humanity using the resources that we have in this day and age to share knowledge is such a gift to all of us thank you so much dr huberman i ve seen tons of your videos and i just really appreciate you
 dopamine acts or areas of the brain give us feelings pleasure satisfaction a motive im glad were all have it or you all doesnt have it how you all using it
 this video was a sort of revelation
 just going to lock myself in a float tank at this point to achieve peak dopamine sensitivity
 what are some alternatives for melatonin for kids my year old son takes melatonin because it s really difficult for him to fall asleep
 thank you very much sir
 thanks so much for taking the time to educate the masses
 what a massive legend
 would ambient only music be okay while working out if i want to focus on one activity
 i have never been mind blown this many times in hours
 ive been taking tyrosine to be able to tan and have never noticed it help with dopamine at all
 just stay away from supplements
 mucuna pruriens kaunch beej is available for rs only for gm at patanjali shop
 im an athlete this has to be the most informative piece pertaining to my life and i love all your work spot on so much makes sense now million thanks for your dedication to informing the public
 every week i inline skate more and more miles i am up to in a day i do it to help my depression but i realize that i need more and more miles to get happy and the good feeling i understand now
 how are we supposed to put down the supplements

 if long lasting dopamin is the goal and why ice water is good what is different about a chemical that increases dopamin without long term without a crash
 i loved the biology part
 i just have one word to say quot mind blowing quot
 thank you sir for all your valuable information i am a lithium patient s nehemiah
 dopamine masterclass just what i needed andrew do you read minds br br br thanks for all that you do i can t claim to understand all of it however all that i do i make notes on your pushing me to dip more and more into neuroscience
 i agree this is brilliant education and very digestible
 i do think he reads this guy is my hero
 can you do an overview of the impact of meditation any specifics on impact transcendental meditation thank you for considering this
 i wonder if low level consumption of coca leaf like say in tea would still be damaging to dopamine
 sadly also confirmed by a psychiatrist i m addicted to dopamine br br i meditated one fo real joga and was never that relaxed and not in need of quot pushing quot
 a great video for learning
 hats off sir
 feel so blessed to live in an era where i can access such a tremendous content so easily thanks you andrew
 this is fascinating
 i meant a collaboration type project i did one with a group of artists amp a neuroscientist in la in shinsuke shimojo at caltech
 guru huberman thank you
 economics students can relate with br marginal utility br positive marginal utility br negative marginal utility
 dear andrew im dxd early mild parkinson a y o woman im on rasagilline br what things can i do take or eat drink to increase my dopamine im desperate trying to keep it from progressing br right now i experienced shaky thumbs hands at times and slight balance issues br thankyou so much br mary delaney
 timed perfectly for day of new semester thank you for everything you teach us and greetings from wales
 all of this is incredibly interesting i don t see how if we get through this troubled times caused by dopamin driven psychopaths and narcissists and their minions with atrophied pre frontal cortexes education can be separated from training to resist dopamine urges porn control regulation of sexual behavior to kids and early teens this time effectively because we know why we are doing it fasting like it s done in muslim countries maybe zero tolerance to parasitism videogames allowed only as reward for positive behavior etc br otherwise we wouldn t even get out of these times because mostly everyone would remain so short in time preference so anti rational and so impulse driven that things could only get worse
 also we need this information summed up in a video animation of eight minutes at max with more simple language for the quot tl dr quot crowd br i could help with that except with making the animation
 i imagine being in his lecture when he pulls out the sponsors of this are
 i listen to professor andrew dopamine hit
 which are the books you recommend in this episode about dopamine thanks
 i think i get an addiction to andrew huberman videos should i do a fasting to his videos
 i love your podcast it has changed my life and my approach to fitness on that nite i would love to hear an episode specifically about overteaining syndrome and exercise addiction how to recognize it and most of all how to deal with get past it br br thank you for bringing science into my life
 from what i understand br avoid hype br enjoy the suck
 you rock keep up the goodies
 i suspect just listening to this has enhanced my dopamine
 love it
 i suffer with tourettes syndrome and and a few medications i had brain surgery like a dbs fitted deep brain stimulation my help for anxiety or depression i worry to much overthinking
 this absolutely blew my mind i have gone through so many waves of intense working out and feeling really great and motivated to then being so depressed and having absolutely no drive or motivation whatsoever this has been an intense cycle my entire life since high school thank you so much for explaining whyyyy this happens and now i have the tools to hopefully never let that happen again
 i bet you feel exactly the same br everyone has the tools but few have the motivation to use them
 this means i can t listen to this podcast while i do household chores
 hearing this highly intelligent man do ad reads makes my dopamine drop
 i usally dont comment but this video was great and usefull really thank you so much and i wish the best evrything for you
 this is by far the most important video i have ever seen on yt
 dr huberman i get dopamine increase through memes too
 the irony of needing this information to understand my adhd but not being able to pay attention for hrs it s sinking in after the rd listen thanks for the knowledges
 i watched it twice and was so in hyperfocus d
 right so i cleaned with it on in the background potted some plants brushed the hounds
 or maybe we need a cold bath to listen to this
 this is so relatable
 that s how i learn too repetition x
 yes thank you i have to pause and start again and listen more than once and take notes so i will not get lost to much but the info is soo worth the effort
 it s so dense with information that you always notice something new every time you rewatch it like a good movie
 omg this is soooooo meeee
 hello guys
 so what happened to your friends child that didnt play video games for days br he didnt have a huge dopamine hit when he played videos after the days br following this logic hed need to fast again from video games to get the same
 hey thank you for the video t was awesome altho i couldn t understand one thing br at
 it only decreases after pleasure
 thanks for useful knowledge
 awsome that great and helpful you knowledge you bring it thank you
 i never watch long videos without skipping but this vid made me not to do that
 this will probably be a life changing podcast for many i know it will be for me thank you andrew
 glad to know humans like this exist
 does nofap or semen retention increase dopamine levels when i am on a high streak usually past days its like i have unlimited source of energy drive and motivation everything in life just feels x better and it is hard to get depressed
 thank you sir as always
 as a medic we carry dopamine to administer to patients with low blood pressure i understand that people going through opiate withdraws have a decrease in dopamine would giving a person micro dosages increase their movement motivation and drive
 what do you think
 love and thanku sir from india
 this should be taught to all addicts i wish i had known this earlier god bless you andrew
 what a buzz kill of a video and thats a good thing
 so the baseline level of dopamine effect one s normal mode and motivation relating to the long term performance and the short term increase or decrease from baseline brings the feeling of joy or upset am i right br i apologize if my english looks kinda weird
 super helpful

 it s funny that i found this video while experimenting with being off of social media except youtube for the month of september
 this needs to be taught in schools thank you so much andrew immense value
 sake even dopamine has more friends than i do
 your are such a legend
 im very gratefull to mr huberman thank his spechs recomendacin their change mi life completly my stack are some huperzine l tyrosine chloine and omega with that my mind is working very good and nice mood too thank you
 thank you again you are saving lives
 just by watching this video i had a dopamine release
 wow thanks for this my mind is blown lots of things are starting to make more sense now br im saddened that more people dont take routes other than mainstream pharmacology when so may natural or free options are available
 so what to do when one gets used to the cold shower lower the temperature extend the time
 cold shower is always going to be beneficial besides in morning in winter you can never fully get used to it
 a good friend is clear on a dark day
 this video can literally change your life
 if the baseline dopamine is low then won t even the smallest increase in dopamine cause a better mood sense of well being why then does the respected dr huberman caution against low baseline of dopamine could somebody please clarify thanks
 great content
 one of the most life changing podcasts i have ever listened to i am was an absolute dopamine junky and using dopamine releasing activities as rest already feeling a difference from stopping that
 podcast discusses dopamine and how it affects motivation focus and satisfaction the podcast dispels myths about dopamine and explores the biology and psychology of the molecule it also discusses neural circuits and dopamine schedules which are ways that certain substances like food drugs or caffeine can change dopamine levels and alter how much satisfaction people experience the podcast provides tools for leveraging dopamine to sustain energy drive and motivation for long periods of time additionally the podcast mentions a study that found cold water exposure can lead to long and sustained dopamine increases which can improve cognition and sense of well being
 i d like to spike your dopamine a bit by letting you know that you helped me solve the biggest challenge of my life
 amazing how a hr min video that s pure science has million views
 this lecture would benefit by the inclusion of some visuals supports
 ive been depressed awhile now for years from military ptsd and life after and now i have heart arithmea have had heart attacks so far im just now learning how eletrolite deficiency affects the heart that ive had for years but bow im wondering if dopamine has any affect on heart arrhythmia heart health in general
 this is one of the best podcasts ive ever heard this was incredibly useful and practical thanks for making this free and accessible to everyone
 so simplistic dude attributes too much to anecdote and theory but still very interesting to hear his take its a minuscule point of view but very well reasoned lots of logic
 why when i start to feel better after having a bad cold flu or covid i start to feel happy is that my dopamine level kicking in
 great class
 that neatly explains the outsized appeal of conspiracy theory lovers and their communities i ve believed that they get addicted to the adrenaline but it s really been only a guess
 awesome teachings
 it has been few times in my life where i have actually enjoyed a lecture about something important yet educational thus boring by default in the reality of our subconscious and this lecture certainly is a memorable one that i will appreciate forever br thanks dr
 fantastic
 what if someone can control his her dopamine through quot imaginations quot br i m die hard fond of making quot imaginations quot about something that has nothing to do with my reality life to the so much highly highly lively level br i ve experienced that sometimes i make happy imagination and i really can feel the subsequent increase found in my dopamine level br similarly when i forge some sorrowful imagination for say imagining my death or the death of some one quite close to me etc i can really feel the deadly drop in my dopamine level so that i ve even experienced literally chocking during such imaginations br br br br p s i love to do psychological and neurological experiments with myself and people around me
 hi andew br please see the word stirhaprgna bhagavadgita in sanksrit that might summarize everything
 thank you andrew
 can somebody please point out the stuff in pre workout that increases you dopamine levels i wanna know what to avoid
 this is my kind of podcast straight to the point explaining things clearly with examples and sources
 heads i forgo all pleasureful activity br tails ketamine
 is this the fair rule br take cold shower bath br drink caffine br be somewhat quot stoic quot with non reactionary to anything when it s effort based br fasting food restriction
 i know and do all the things you told in these vedio i know them my seeing my pattern in life by writing diary and reviewing it seeing what might be the reason for everything i do i try to b be conscious
 i just love you thank you so much
 thank you so much
 i feel like these monday drops are the glue that holds my life together
 im here for that glue
 me too
 beats the heck out of elmer s that s for sure
 adamtomecko lmao
 hopefully you get a life real soon
 it is a great way to put momentum on the week
 awesome to read lt
 monday medicine man
 huberman the glue berman
 better than gorilla
 that sounds like the start of a glue habit
 better begin restricting yourself to watch his videos only at random times to ensure intermittent release of dopamine
 so you are doing exactly what you are not suppposed to do

 which are the pre workout ingredients that are stimulants beta alanine citruline i dont think so the main one is caffeine so quite dont get it on that one
 you also came from vaibhav sir short video br br congratulations u r in group of people
 i have no motivation none at all i do everything on raw mental self forcing it s been like this for many years and i have long suspected some sort of dopamine deficiency which i can trace back to daily psylocibin dosages for months when i was after this long trip i was completely changed and had this motivational syndrome anything that stimulated dopamine production would reverse this condition and i would become normal again and can function this month trip was over years ago and i still have no motivation it s absolutely horrible and every day is a struggle there are some substances which help but they are illegal if i tell my gp they just say i am depressed and put me on antidepressants which i dont take any more because they do not work amphetamine sulphate works best but i cannot find this and have not done any for years i am toying with the idea of making some using a simple lithium pseudoephedrine synthesis illegal of course but i dont care about the law
 so should we take caffeine and then take cold water exposure for better effects
 this is the greatest lesson of all times that everyone should learn at max i hope someone translates this info into other languages and spreads around thank you so much
 best understanding for indians because of simple english

 if someone is taking adderall for their adhd and has been for years would your recommendation to then go off of this medication
 andrew i just want to say i truly love your passion as a neuroscientist and you are so willing to share your knowledge to everyone who is interested in what you have to say i want to thank you for what you have been doing and sharing with the world much love from singapore
 if i go to heaven i will ask god if i can meet you thank you so much for what you do
 so if someone stops doing all pleasurable things stands in a room all day eats tasteless food etc will their baseline dopamine be extremely high will they love life also is the maximum possible net reward neutral regarding dopamine vs the crash thats kind of sad if the best possible life is neutral
 im so confusing
 huberman lab episodes spike my dopamine
 what should someone do that has a high threshold of joy history but now has a low dopamine state

 i m going to write up a scientific review for one of my modules at university on this topic it s super interesting learning and understanding the dopaminergic circuits in our brains and how it can alter our thoughts and actions it s definitely a contemporary issue in medical science and indeed in our latest generations as a whole with the introduction of dopaminergic overstimulation through phones devices and easy access stimulants thanks for everything doc
 life changing podcast big thanks andrew
 would it be possible for you to go in depth as to what cannabis does to the brain it s dopamine and glutamate because and i hate to admit it but i have been a fairly heavy user of this plant for about years i am now airing out but what would really help is understanding the brain science behind it and its negative effects from overindulgence
 really great episode
 i am the emotionally abused partner of a malignant narcissist i cannot break free i cannot go no contact i cannot protect myself as he has me on a horrific schedule of intermittent reinforcement and i am addicted to his doling out of crumbs it works fabulously to keep me trapped how do you break free of a perfectly timed schedule of dopamine hits tied to a toxic individual
 is the dopamine release from social connection long lasting
 this episode explains why mondays are so lame after a fun weekend thanks andrew for everything specially for making mondays fun in spite of being below dopamina baseline
 yes and the blues after traveling
 imagine taking mptp thinking youre going to get an opioid fix and you wind up being dope sick in a vegetative state
 i got nothing else to lose ill watch
 anphatemines ruined my life i was misdiagnosed with adhd thanks to the failed medical system of the world
 i m late to andrew huberman does he ever actually write anything with his pen or it s just something fun to emote with
 does it really matter
 when is the best time to do something that gives dopamine if i cant do it right before or after
 thanks for the great podcast again br i m wondering if taking a cold shower everyday increases the baseline dopamine release isn t that resulting in depletion of the dopamine supply over time
 inshallah i will become a neuroscientist like you one day and have a talk with you in one of your podcasts
 the most important be podcast i have ever listened to
 one of the very rare people who can make a hour video and get million view
 did anyone actually get a good understanding of how to gain a better base line
 quot by oscar wilde quot i can resist anything except temptation quot
 great episode well done did you think about covering the topic of anger physical and biochemical reactions when we are in state of anger wish you much luck in the future keep up the good work
 neurobiology science and bhagvat geeta spirituality say the same thing in different languages focus on hard work to release dopamine not the reward only then the work is karma yoga and the reward comes naturally without expectations
 what s the science behind developing interest and enjoyment in activities how do we physiologically come to the conclusion that we enjoy whatever the activity is
 my dopamine levels are going up from watching this video
 confused about that study so how did they get random children to draw like to draw if its randomly sampled and he claimed the researchers didnt evoke them to draw they just enjoyed doing it
 ksznjk
 this came to me at exactly the right moment amazing insight i have always felt much of this to be true intuitively instinctually but i was never able to put this into words this kind of science facinates me i also really appreciate the way you tie it up and focus on healthy relationships at the conclusion thanks
 was not prepared for this video i was playing softball and you pitched a fastball and i hate softball will set aside proper time to listen and learn i m at the point now where i m trying to say quot fuck dopamine i got shit to do and i m going to just have to get it done quot so far all that s gotten me is sitting in the middle of projects posting this message nb a certain quot influence quot has me popping up quot wanting quot to work on projects but it also distracts from just getting the job done all sorts of creativity comes to my mind which then becomes the purpose great results but extends the time for each project tenfold

 adhd is thought to be a disorder in dopamine what effect do stimulants have if any on dopamine
 you mentioned ritalin and adderall what about vyvanse i m considering kicking it into touch as i have noticed that i m permanently angry when i take it
 yes nicotine is quick release in duration but you said particularly in cigarette smoking what about nicotine replacement especially the delivery of nicotine through a transdermal patch would this be a longer duration of dopamine release because it s a slow release method that you wear once or twice a day in comparison to oral ingestion like a cigarette which is delivered in full within minutes
 thank you so much for this
 this was absolutely amazing and the way you explained these things helped me to really grasp everything thank you so much br ps this should be part of training for all professors and teachers how to teach anything so the pupils can absorb it
 professor s advice not a fan of relying on any external substance regularly for motivation or mental work
 farming i get kicked in the nuts irregularly and often bet then something great happens a baby calf is born a harvest is successful there s a beautiful thing somewhere it s hard but the best life i know
 i figured that about dopamine seeing we are designed for change and something new like doing the same exercise is not good for your body seeing you have to change it up to for different muscles or take a break hmm thinking about hiit and how you get a rush
 if your threshold for enjoyment goes up as a result of engagement with activities you enjoy does that also mean then that valuing effort over outcome around
 excellent video
 this is my first podcast from dr huberman very practical and helpful and he kept all the contents of the video very simple and understandable and his soothing voice is great br br and certainly last but not the least thank you teaching us science
 funny you say antipsychotics make you feel very bad worst ever feeling and extremely unmotivated cause thats exactly how i feel on them but i can t stop them as i have schizophrenia and i am on a high dose of the nd strongest antipsychotic clozapine being strongest do you think its possible to rewire the sz brain and cure sz stopping meds and never relapsing again my psychiatrists told me i have to take meds for the rest of my life i was diagnosed at y o my attempts of stopping meds always failed and sometimes was a disaster ended in mental hospital emergency brought by cops i can t even reduce my dose as i get instant symptoms i can t even skip one of the doses i take daily i have been taking huperzine a and i think it helps a bit as i am no longer always in bed like the previous years i still stay in bed but much less than before thanks for mentioning huperzine a
 also i read huperzine a increases dopamine in the frontal lobe without increasing dopamine in the dorsal striatum so it does not worsen schizophrenia positive symptoms
 anon you forgot to take your pills
 i wonder if the cold environment is why people in nordic countries are so happy
 they cooperate more so everyone ends up feeling better overall better community ideals
 me with adhd okay mr gerard butler i hear you
 honest question if we see dopamine as universal currency how do we explain the drive and hunger to feed and reproduce displayed by bacteria unicellular organisms or other life forms with very simple nervous systems especially before the emergence of developed animals
 from wikipedia dopamine br dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter in vertebrates echinoderms arthropods molluscs and several types of worm br br dopamine has been reported in the nervous systems of many other radially symmetric species including the cnidarian jellyfish hydra and some corals this dates the emergence of dopamine as a neurotransmitter back to the earliest appearance of the nervous system over million years ago in the cambrian period br br the dopamine in plants is synthesized from the amino acid tyrosine by biochemical mechanisms similar to those that animals use
 i wonder if this is why adhd ppl suffer from time issues we rely on stimulants to stay focused
 my favourite podcast honestly your speech and teaching manners are so mesmerizing to me i hope more people discover this gem of a content much love from bulgaria lt
 please slowdown age kigali about biology terms i need to write them down with captions you talked too fast for me to write it down lol br br thank you so much for your video i have a few questions i am not sure if im correct br br from what you said i linked increase or higher dopamine levels may cause cancer pleas let me know if im correct
 i see here people underestimating the impact of dr hubermanns podcast in my opinion theres huge potential for public impact from this true youtube might not be around forever and not all are here watching br br still there are not many who would even care to do something like this many professors and researchers couldnt care more about peer acknowledgement and such public education is not seen as valuable for your own academic career its for the elite br br then there are these people who truly care and do it well because most researchers wouldnt be able to present this good and with examples etc it would be boring this is not boring its never the content its the presentation and the human touch that counts thats how i see it ive seen the inside of a university so i know a little
 you are great thank you
 thanks
 very much information for my small brain
 this is probably one of the most useful podcasts ever made thank you
 well after watching this my entire typical world view is slowly shifting towards a more informative view br br now i get why i m bored and lethargic some days thanks dr huberman this is extremely helpful i m grateful
 i doubt this is gonna get me off of heroine
 this whole podcast episodes increases dopamine alone
 mess with stomach make me physically exhausted br everyday a different effect depressed or angry or brain fog br br so i only take mg vyvanse then x mg pure dextroamphetamine br vyvanse helps dextroamphetamine gently act and last longer and more stable br so untold effect of vyvanse is to slow down dextroamphetamine which is very beneficial for me when combine with dextroamphetamine br br br vyvanse has different psychological effect than pure dextroamphetamine
 dopamine is the pinnacle of what comes up must come down
 this has completely changed the way i see and navigate through my human experience such a profound shift in perception has happened only a few times in my life thank you
 do you think it is bad to listen to music while going to the campus or the gym
 its sorta sad that in order to live in our society we have to live a scheduled yearly lifestyle of temporary fun activities and that if we have too much fun in one activity then we have to stop doing it for a little while sorta depressing hahah it sorta means that all good feeling things eventually wont be good feeling and its your job to make it good feeling so absurd
 it also reminds me of the idea that our ancestors in the savannah would just lay around for hours just chilling literally doing nothing haha resting maybe but in our society thats called laziness cuz that time would be better spent being productive i guess you just need a core belief on why a certain activity is detrimental and then just find ways to make it fun every single time it starts to get boring so strange

 if you enjoy an activity it produces dopamine or if an activity produces dopamine you enjoy it
 that channel is pure gold
 as an avid meditator roughly hour per day this lesson makes a lot of sense of the possible benefits of meditation especially after high levels of pleasure stress one could hypothesize that shutting out all stimulation and finding stillness would reset the baseline levels of dopamine so that normal tasks would become motivating rewarding again what are your thoughts
 not quite the avid meditator that you are but i had similar thoughts when hearing some of this and considering how mindfulness trains you to sit with an experience without reaction perhaps retraining or resetting that baseline level and even re sensitising you to other tasks i even wonder if it helps keep the peaks from being excessive and thus keeps the constant motivation more continuous
 bentleymayes great points
 bigfooooot i like that idea too
 i thought he said even meditating releases dopamine for some people my thoughts are being bored would be the best way to reset and not use dopamine lol
 cmo yes very subjective but basically if meditation is full and boringdo it
 not sure if that timescale is relevant or not compared to just doing some low dopamine activity like chores this whole conversation seems to me like if you actually want to enjoy life more you ll need to commit a day per week to fully ascetic isolation
 jmass well it s kinda like fasting day a week isn t that bad to disconnect from tech and go inside your body and mind who knows maybe you will get new ideas that didn t have a way to come out because of constant dopamine rush and distraction caused by smartphones and other dopamine inducing things
 flochfitness i ve rarely if ever felt bored in meditation when i used to do it i m intending to start again as i remember the feeling of transcendental meditation was a phenomenal experience i would not consider it boring at all i actually wonder if there isn t a major dopamine serotonin release in that type of experience
 glyphto that would be a great study
 a verse in scripture advises the same attitude toward action and the results fruits of the actions br br you have the right to work but for the work s sake only you have no right to the fruits of work desire for the fruits of work must never be your motive in working never give way to laziness either br br perform every action with your heart fixed on the supreme lord renounce attachment to the fruits be even tempered in success and failure for it is this evenness of temper that is meant by yoga br br work done with anxiety about results is far inferior to work done without such anxiety in the calm of self surrender seek refuge in the knowledge of brahma they who work selfishly for results are miserable br bhagavad gita
 quot but sex nicotine cocaine amphetamine those things cause increases in dopamine in everybody that takes them quot honest question how can i quot take sex quot i know he s speaking about chemicals here but doesn t sex belong in the category of behaviours like he says quot exercise studying hard work working through a challenge is going to be subjective to how much dopamine is released quot br br sex isn t something we ingest or am i missing something
 do what is for what br br sex is for reproduction to continue the generation br br but we humans sex just to inc the dopamine br it s just not love
 love you huberman
 if you put your worksheet in front of you you won t need to look down
 please include visuals also for better understanding
 your work is beyond normal praise the amount of good you are delivering practically free for the people of this world is unbelievable a nobel prize for doing good should be made in your name while making you the first recipient of the same i fail to accept that this is free on a weekly basis the notification of yours is a big dopamine trigger for me
 why doesn t cold water exposure deplete dopamine and reduce the baseline like the rest of stimulants
 maybe cause a shivering soaked primate needs more motivation to survive than a dry warm one
 best postcast for understand the brain works levels of dopamine
 great video
 this is the most comprehensive structural logical well backed and all encompassing piece on dopamine and motivation in general that i have ever scene after hearing and casually searching about dopamine this served piece served as a lightbulb moment for me where it all really clicked and from which i can really extract implementable ideas for my life thank you so much for this br br i have so many questions but one is glaringly obvious and i can t help without what is the difference between the mechanisms of addictive harmful drugs like cocaine and prescription and non prescription ones like mucuna pruriens both kinds temporarily increase dopamine with a crash afterwards so why is one so detrimental addictive while the other is considered so innocuous that we can get them otc
 the alien percentage in our dna is so powerful that made us so disconnected from our body and in order to function properly we need to use our alien intelligence and study our own brain to acquire knowledge on how our body works lol
 my dopamine is so low that even when i graduate college it doesn t make me feel anything
 i found the info regarding peaks and baselines super informative it explains e chemical droop after a major win or accomplishment of some sort also really helpful about trying to link effort with reward to keep motivated threw the difficult moments of attaining something a huberman and loretta breuning collab of some sort would be mind blowing
 great video
 just like serotonin has nothing to do with depression soon we will propably hear the same thing about dopamine not having anything to do with quot rewards quot
 an amazing podcast which really opened my mind on how actually i have been living my life and how dopamine is really effecting it from now i will definitely use your principles to make a good change in my life also growth mindset is to focus on
 watching this is escaping the uncomfortable so do you work against hour dopamine system by making this video s
 i was serching about how masturbation afect my life but this video is much better explanation of problem that i have problem that does not only include masturbation

 is it possible taking a cold shower lead to high blood pressure desease
 i think this is how i survived the last yrs as caregiver for my severely disabled terminal daughter i had to stay in the moment in service to keep a positive loving attitude i could not know when the end would come the end would mean mine or her death i had to find quot joy in the journey quot i do think my base line dopamine is very low esp after her difficult death br looking forward to finding joy in my new journey hence the welbutrin for now
 respect for you and my condoleances now it is time to chose for yourself
 great attitude

 i am a medical student recently i feel so miserable in my life for no reason i don t enjoy the things i did before i thought that there is something wrong with me but now i can understand that low level of dopamine level could be the reason for that thank you so much for all these informations i am going to improve myself better

 good lucky bro i hope you can reach your goal and improve your mental health
 this podcast is the single most helpful resource out there for health and self improvement i listened to this episode last week and i noticed a lot of things about my body that i previously didn t even think about
 l
 i just increased my dopamine release by learning how to increase my dopamine release thanks andrew
 oh yeah yeah
 i just increased my dopamine release by reading a comment of how a person increased their dopamine release by learning how to increase their dopamine release
 i m watching this for the second time and i m recalling how i learned to control what i now understand to be bipolar tendencies in my mid twenties was to not allow myself to get over excited and in doing so i didn t crash emotionally afterwards or if things didn t work out as planned after listening to this video i realize what i was doing was regulating my dopamine levels in a round about way br br my challenge now is that i have to take progivil to work as a home health nurse because of narcolepsy and i crash when it wears off which makes going home and finishing my charting absolute drudgery besides being grueling anyway i will definately try pea or l tyrosine those evenings and tell myself i enjoy it br br thanks a million for the wealth of info you are truly a godsend
 have you tried gym healhy food and friends
 thank you for this im an opiate addict and im getting ready to put myself in detox and rehab for the second time ive learned so much more about dopamine and the biomechanisms of addiction and i have a ba in neuropsychology but this video filled in a lot of blanks for me with great details and was a great refresher from my college years dont listen to people who say he is a quack many of the studies he uses here i remember learning about in college he uses a mix of established peer reviewed data and also suggests emerging ideas based on new studies in the field overall dr h is very well informed and explains these seemingly complicated studies very well
 just to recap for the people who don t have time to go through whole thing br go through whole thing it s pure gold br thank you andrew you are the best there is
 love all the science thank you for doing what you do dr huberman
 as a former drug addict who ended up incarcerated for three years by age ultimately because of addiction and now year old mama with intense executive function issues i believe this information is incredibly important for me to teach my four children two of whom are neurodiverse br the oldest is only but from here out i want this to be a regular part of the mental health discussions we have in our home i am so thankful for this information my question is how can i help them especially one who struggles deeply with attention impulsivity and refusal of anything that doesnt feel enjoyable trick their brains into enjoying the process and pursuit of things for example doing chores or finishing their homeschool work rather than just living for the end goal id love to learn some practical gentle and age appropriate ways to help them begin to foster this sort of intentionality early on in life
 you re a beautiful person it s criminal how the system keeps us suppressed then blame us for not knowing xx
 same here the ability to teach our kids this at early age is crucial
 have your children been tested or treated for adhd driven to distraction and delivered from distraction by hallowell and ratey will help greatly you can borrow either online through a digital library or an actual library
 this is so fascinating dr huberman thank you for the content you are disseminating i frequently watched your videos while studying for the mcat and i must say that there were several times during the exam when came i across a question i knew the answer to because of your youtube videos br br i did well on the mcat and have had several interviews to california medical schools hoping to be able to work alongside with you someday
 oh my gosh congrats on doing well on the mcat thats amazing
 your ability to make extremely complex ideas sound simple is incredible appreciate your dedication to free information in the spirt have you ever thought of putting your content on lbry odysee
 why not joystream then
 you might just have saved my life im stuggling hard with addiction my motivation overall is extremly depleted and i ve been doing those same behaviors of high dopamine bursts for more than a decade listening to all this informations changes everything i knew what was my problem but the fact to know how and why is game changing thanks for this knowledge i have the power to control my system my life thanks again

 discovered you through ad on insta and this podcast literally just put my last years of depression in context i think this just changed my life i have literally been using hypnosis to trick myself into doing work but every time i felt a boost from succeeding the next day i would literally lose two days in demotivation wow wow wow
 whats the hypnosis trick
 anthonyquevedo see above
 wealthy mystic see above
 beautiful podcast andrew honestly love how in depth you go with your subjects could you do a video on cannabis effects on brain form and function
 hi andrew br i have adhd and id be honest i doubt i could stay focused for over hours on this video br but ill try as many times as needed br cheers for good info
 i did intermittent fasting for months from through and not only did i drop from to lbs but my personality has changed drastically i went from being in a depressing mental fog with no energy to exercising daily and feeling incredibly motivated and happier than i ever thought possible i now see that it was due to dopamine release from my effort what an incredible video thank you so much for this invaluable tool that you ve given to the world i wish i was rich so i could send you money but all i ve got is love so take it
 awesome story thanks for sharing with us
 exactly what a failing software engineering student needs thx doc
 stop talking about your shortcomings putting thzt in the universe is the last thing you should do you arent failing you are growing you only fail when you stop trying to be better dont quit and stop focusing on negativity br br i lost k in the market over years i had k left when years of staring at charts started to pay off i wanted to quit xs but no matter what happened i shook it off learned from my mistakes and moved forward br br i now think making under k a day is me failing i had my first k trade a few months back thats all because i refused to quit i never focused on bad and always found a way you will do the same you will succeed
 same lol
 come to the blue collar side come to the blue collar side

 bruu logic design is so fing hard hahaa
 try meditation my friend
 new cs grad here and i was there youll get through it keep grinding and if youre watching andrew huberman im already confident youre on the right path br br lmk if you need any help with anything
 keep going
 dont give up youre not failing you just need a little less stress and a little more time to learn your subjects but for now you just need to keep going it gets better champ
 hey good luck
 lol this is too relatable
 youre not a failure brother you just havent found the thing you were uniquely meant to do
 hang in there brother
 loconojokodaytrading q
 write a specific step by step plan make a true commitment in your mind hate amp avoid anyything that gets in the way of purely planned day with a passion always be aware of inner demons waiting to force you away from your path celebrate gains of every day consistence is the true master br you can also forget drinking carbs in food females amp games the way of monk also works all the kungfu masters proves it
 i became addicted to heroin at and struggled with addiction for nearly a decade i experienced some of the darkest moments of my life during those years there were a handful of times in which i literally felt my life was over br br i was eventually able to overcome addiction taught myself how to write code and completely immersed myself in learning and self improvement now i m running two software companies have a stable income and life and best of all my days no longer revolve around finding and using drugs br br no matter how hopeless and helpless you feel always remember that those emotions are fleeting the human mind has the power to overcome itself by being selective in how your internal monologue responds to the thoughts and feelings that rise to the surface of consciousness you can over time modulate the thoughts and feelings which you experience in the future br br what does that mean it means be careful what you tell yourself what you put out into the world and how long you let yourself hold onto negative thoughts and emotions even if you feel like a failure don t call yourself a failure tell yourself quot i ll do better tomorrow quot
 get a sociology degree
 sleeplessdev excellent
 sleeplessdev im so happy you took the time to write this thank you this helps a lot

 fight thru it much love
 lol could relate to that
 alejandrodelmango this is actually huge advice i hated myself for so long didnt know what i was good at i struggled for soooo long in college finally discovered i was insanely good at design had some self esteem for the first time anyways its good to see others acknowledge we actually were put on this planet to do something
 duncanbug glad you found your way man
 i have been a developer for more than y and this feeling of fail will be alway there eg something new comes around eg new framework language complex project you need to learn again you feel like total beginner all the time even if you have been coding for years thats sometimes depressing but as this video shows quot just do it learn to love the pain it will get better quot
 dude i wish i would have been smart enough to take classes from you you are the man
 i m so inspired i fed my kids a low sugar breakfast i told them we are resetting our dopamine response by minimizing serum glucose spikes they haven t talked to me in days sooo winning thanks doc
 trick kids into not wanting sugar by using the food professor huberman mentioned in one of his podcasts that flips your sweet and sour receptors probably a freudian misattribution the sweet and sour part
 ounceblunt using the food professor
 actuitivevisrl i hear there s a kind of berry that does that just search quot make sour things taste sweet quot or similar and you ll find it br now i don t know if artificial sweeteners are healthy or what it would be like growing up in a household where i eat a dessert berry before my sour desserts interesting times these are

 lol they are probably crabby from the sugar withdrawal but will soon feel x better
 i wish i could tell you that one day they will realize you did it out of care

 next tell them bananas and walnuts and crushed pistachios smothered in plain greek yogurt zero sugar is a new ice cream treat br br let us know what happens
 ok i got a question i do not have a problem with dopamine spikes i am not getting rewards or excitement im at the bottom im in the basement with little to no energy how do i get started to have some higher level of dopamine to get motivated and get going my problem is not a low due to too many prior highs
 why doesnt the cold water immersion cause a harmful spike in dopamine resulting in a lower baseline im confused
 it has always been intriguing how my friends who have gone through vipassana say it s been hard but also most not all of them say it s been awesome and they want to do it again now i think maybe it s because it allows them to go to baseline and get back to life in a fresh way
 how long and how often was the vipassana meditation
 gregallen vipassana is a day silent meditation retreat and you can repeat it according to your needs
 i like how he is talking about aiming to love the effort itself and that you can actually see that on his face while he s talking from the beginning to the end thank you sir i admire your work get so much from it and love the way you talk
 this is one of your best episodes thank you andrew
 thank you andrew really appreciate you sharing your knowledge with us
 i love you sooo much andrew i m sorry if you have a wife you are just so amazing i ve followed you for a long time and you inspired me through your personal story of when you talked about being a small boy when your parents separated etc br br i also went through traumatic events as a child including sexual abuse from the age of i m now in my s and i have healed over the years through thorough research br i now like you want to help others i m studying my masters in neuroscience and psychology on mental health and all your lectures have been a life saver i just finished my first module in neuroscience you helped me get through this thank you andrew
 quot i m sorry if you have a wife quot girl this is gross cringe and honesly offensive do better
 i was reading unbroken the story about the u s military airmen who were stranded in the pacific during wwii there s a short passage about when they drifted into the doldrums after weeks on the raft instead of writing quot we were in a torturous hell starving and not going anywhere quot he describes it as one of the most peaceful serene moments of his entire life br br i can t help but think at that point they had been so bereft of any dopamine rewarding anything for so long that they were perfectly honed to appreciate the extreme stillness of that moment
 yes
 the body including the brain will do anything to survive in some instances it will shut your conscious mind next thing you know woke in hospital stable sometimes the body is much better without you

 such a fantastic video for a person who is so interested in spirituality and hinduism neuro sciences appears fascinating i guess spirituality starts when mankind has figured out all the neural pathways and their workings because this forms the content of the mind br br and distancing yourself from the rumblings of the mind is one of the goals of spirituality apart from knowing that the physical part of our life is just a reflection of a deeper non physical self br we release dopamine when we enjoy an activity why we enjoy just that activity and not something else why cant we enjoy every activity like the ones we usually enjoy why do children enjoy every activity these questions cannot be answered with physical experiments i am sure andrew at some point in his life will turn to spirituality for answers br br it is also stated in the bhagwad gita do your work with dedication focus love and selflessness and do not attach yourself to the result fascinating to see that finding relevance with dopamine
 that s great
 great thoughts br but children do not enjoy every activity i assure you
 exactly not just this podcast rather many of his videos resemble hindu scriptures br and it shows how advanced indian yogis were when it comes to happiness fitness etc
 so true sharan advait vedanta is the answer
 ankitanand anytime someone claims anything is the answer they are completely delusional there are thousands of answers there are happy people living many lifestyles also there are miserable people and tons of them following every spiritual path
 as a hindu i agree but no one will feel like following it if this explanation isn t given it s the same issue with any religion they don t give a detailed science based explaination hard to follow in today s world with out it

 i m at this stage currently where i feel the same as your past self hating my job yet working for the incentives that depend on so many other factors as well i know i need to be pursuing a different career but my indecisiveness has become such a hurdle anyway its really nice to know that someone out there was able to move out of a similar situation and be at a better stage
 i think you misunderstood what he said it s not a healthy lifestyles changing jobs whenever you get bored you should learn how to enjoy your current job and make it fulfill your baseline dopamine level you definitely shouldn t be chasing dopamine from one job to another
 thanks andrew you are doing a great service you have certainly helped make my life better and im sure many other people too keep doing what you re doing
 i m in my poor country studying artificial intelligence i deeply appreciate people like dr huberman for educating people like me and giving us a chance to learn how to live better and healthier with zero cost br keep up the good work sir
 i love you man we are all gonna make it
 what country is that i sincerely hope you can improve the people around you even if not your country hang in there
 badgerlife dont worry he has internet in a poor country so hes at least from middle class if not bourgeoisie and maybe got caught up in the victimhood mentality like a lot of us out there
 kaeso in my opinion a poor country is where most of the people aren t educated due to money problems and don t have enough spare time to learn on their own
 badgerlife thanks dude that s indeed my goal to improve and love myself and other people around me
 one of the best episodes ever listening to it once again thank you dr andrew
 i love how excited he gets about the intricate aspects of this stuff quot the pathway involved in dopamine just a beautiful pathway quot
 brilliant podcast one of my favorites from andrew
 y know thing about huberman content is that it often times confirms the suspicion or theory you ve had just by having experienced its negative effects for so long you understand immediately when he describes these things in actual scientific way thank you so much for your work
 i wonder if what we think of as a mid life crisis is actually related to the slow decline of baseline dopamine for typical quot work hard play hard quot types
 interesting point years old and having the hardest time of my like keep trying to find my old self but dont have the drive to do the things she used to do now i may have a path forward out of this hell
 susanrenick ditto m no drive no enjoyment just been put on antidepressants
 something to think about
 wanted to come back in to share my results and findings on what dr huberman has been saying br br i felt my dopamine has been depleted so i tried some things the past few weeks cut out coffee caffine i drank it everyday video games played everyday and focused more in my career school and being a father i also tell myself i love the effort during work and school instead of saying quot i can t wait for friday quot i also do interminent fasting and take cold showers my replacement for caffine everyday which is great also for dopamine br br br i have never felt better and it s not like i m overly happy it s more i m at peace and a bad day isn t too bad and a good day isn t too good i m just leveled out taking it day by day and i don t even think much about the reward rather thats completing a project or being financially independent one day i just focus on today but at the same time understand the future will most likely come so make the correct decisions today to make your life easier tomorrow br br understanding dopamine and hacking it has changed my life dr huberman you are the bro
 quot learn to spike your dopamine from effort itself quot for me the phrase of this video tx andrew excelent info
 how do you learn to spike dopamine from effort if hard work isn t providing it to start with
 actuitivevisrl have you watched the video
 actuitivevisrl inorder to spike enough dopamine from effort you ll have to let go of quick short spikes in dopamine like using your phone playing games masterbating etc basically dopamine fast only then you ll be able to enjoy hardwork i guess
 asking the audience has he done an episode specifically on trauma and ptsd and such looking for information on that the episodes are long and i love it which poses a constraint on how long it might take for me to get to the appropriate episode
 years ago i was diagnosed with parkinson s so i m more interested in the movement aspect of dopamine you ve given me a lot to analyze it looks like it s time for a deep dive thanks for opening this door
 hope you are well my grandmother had parkinsons disease for in her older years i think i possibly have something similar i get rls and it is miserable i often or always to a certain degree feel like my legs are crawling or something like that hard to describe i feel like i constantly have to move or kick my legs i stretch to the point it really hurts but i focus on the pain instead of the crawling feeling the pain is actually better feeling than the crawling feeling been to many doctors but they dont really take it serious or not at all
 hi keith my dad was diagnozed with parkinson this week i wish you hope and courage i ve been reading and viewing huberman podcast recently and struggle to come up with concrete routines or practicess to slow down dopamine receptors from dying i would greatly appreciate a special episode on this topic or any adviced
 this is truly amazing every one should learn this thank you
 excellent thank you dr huberman question if dopamine affects perception of time what could cause a person to have no useful perception of time
 i have wrecked my dopamine levels through various drugs for years the happiest i have been is with my wife and also cold water immersion which was my job as a commercial diver cold water mm suit no drysuit or hot water suit i would be very interested in a study on surfers dopamine levels comparing cold water surfers to warm water just moved right on a beachfront and have some cold sea to play in again early swims a few times a week are happening and it works
 interesting andrew should do an interview with the guy from my octopus teacher and talk about the neuroscience of cold water swimming diving pets and octopuses that d be mightely fascinating
 znorfel those are my home waters i got to play with a baby octopus the size of a coin in the same place that was filmed definitely very cold water to dive in
 what drugs
 fleecejohnson cocaine ecstasy ritalin codeine cathinones
 it would be interesting to see you do a video on stimulants particularly adderall i have adhd and can t imagine not failing out of college without adderall i was prescribed it when this year at years old before then it was virtually impossible to get anything done i passed high school with average grades without studying what so ever and always doing assignments last second now on adderall i m getting close to a gpa when i ve always been a gpa student so it s very conflicting when i here the downsides to amphetamine use br love your videos btw
 well i do think he s been referring all along to the downside of street use of aderall by just about everyone and anyone who are not add but that because of their unhealthy habits lifestyle rely on adderall to get them through a situation not because they have add or adhd but just because it s so much easier than cleaning up their act this does not at all apply to someone like you based on your comment here
 barbarafairbanks thank you for explaining further greatly appreciate it
 quot the ability to excess pleasure from effort aspect of our dopaminergic circuitry is without question the most powerful aspect of dopamine and our biology do not spike dopamine prior to engaging in effort and do not spike dopamine after engaging in effort learn to spike your dopamine from effort itself quot
 hubermanity giving life back to humans thank you
 well it s time for a cup of coffee and a notebook thank you sir for this magnificent lab
 i love your podcast and have been sharing them with my family thanks i would love to see you interview dr joe dispenza and hear your take on gene expression thanks again
 i agree a discussion between joe dispenza and huberman would be fantastic
 in turkey we have an old saying we laughed so much something bad will happen and a second saying who laughs a lot cries a lot this made me think of the peak of dopamine followed by below baseline dopamine explained by these sayings
 interesting how we have the same saying in india as well
 yup in india it goes like quot the more you laugh the more you cry quot
 in my house india if you have fun for day you can t have on another
 hahah nice well said
 tattwamasishwetketu zaada hasoge toh utna hi roge
 in kazakh culture we have just the same
 there is an identical saying in serbia as well very interesting though understandable given historical context
 this guy has really helped me be healthier even at years old
 love it very informative and clearly presented
 fascinating i now want to be a neuroscientist epic knowledge
 emily p gotta go for it
 andrew thank you brother adhd diagnosed at young age kid here youtube brought me here as i ve followed you awhile and i figured why not understand this dopamine more i filled a notebook excited to take control of my dopamine but not too excited hahaha much love
 my son has autism i came here and this clears many concepts his speech is delayed he is years old
 this was such an amazing podcast what i took away is that i need to re stabilize my levels of dopamine and just make sure to enjoy the process love this thanks so much
 easily the most informative eye opening fascinating video ive ever watched as a man who has suffered serious bouts of depression in my life the first lasting years and the nd one being just recent lasting nearly months but far more intense and including suicidal ideation this information feels like an incredibly gratifying revelation as ive been digging through psychology and science to understand myself and others more this video got placed onto my lap it seems and just wow another vital piece of the mental puzzle br thank you for existing andrew you are a special guy a man whos purpose is to directly change the lives of others through your selfless search for the truth god bless you brother thanks for the tools br br joshua morrison uk age
 can i ask you how you pulled yourself out of your depressive state
 loulou sorry i never seen this comment reply
 my parents were having a healthy active retirement until the pandemic now after lockdowns and ineffective vaccines they are afraid to go back to the gym and are showing signs of dementia i read that your team has been studying alzheimers can you point me to resources to slow or reverse the decline thank you dr huberman i appreciate all that you do and all the lives you are improving with your platform
 exactly the same for my octagenarian neighbor pre pandemic she sstarted and maintained a senior computer center gave tour of the neigborhood to tourists made food carefully tailored food packages from tour restaurant leftovers and neighborhood food pantry offerrings to tighly economically limited neigbors methodically consistently and quietly discovered a newfound occupation as a personal assistant to a documentary film maker and then pandemic restrictions hit lobotomized san francisco and a fear to go out that continues to this day her life force and cognitive quickness seems to have waned this shows how a lifestyle that includes purpose social engagement and stimulation and serving the needs of others using our personal capacity can have noticeable and rapid changes in our overall health

 if there is one thing i truly regret doing in my life is smoking weed daily for some years br thanks for the podcast as always exquisite and precise
 cold showers foraging addiction gold stars growth mindset the rewarding properties of deprivationthis is so powerful
 so i used to the quot stacking quot of dopamine as well i stacked like different sources coffee chocolate liquor order food mj beer modafinil game porn etc and before long i got sooooooooooooooooooooo depressed i would just burst into sobs and i couldn t stop i was suicidal thankfully body has natural equilibrium so it corrected itself but it took like good months to come back to normal levels again don t abuse your system guys it s not worth the pain
 you still smoke mj
 listening to michael jackson is too much
 chronic weed use is the motivation killer then alcohol then video games then porn it takes me like months to recover after quitting weed ive quit a couple times before and just quit again months ago still in a bad state of focus and motivation save yourselves stop listening to the rappers and your low life friends weed will likely destroy you unless youre the in a million who is productive on weed everyone is different
 davyddocarmocabral this comment is still cracking me up
 thank you so much for doing this i learn so much from your videos
 invaluable information my dopamine levels will continue to rise after this podcast
 maybe this explains why after having some really good highly productive days i sometimes get single really bad depressive days where i don t wanna do anything
 yup this is why the concept of a quot hustle quot or quot grind quot is cancer imo and results focused hard work in general it s simply not sustainable or practical it s all about working smart in a way that s practical and long term br br there s a time and a place for working as hard as you can to maximize short term productivity and results but only in special circumstances
 jwstreeter yea i learned this the hard way through years of highs and subsequent crashes ironically i wasted more time this way than if i had just worked at a more sustainable pace with more breaks i think consistency is the only thing that really matters
 i ve been struggling with the same exact thing glad i m not the only one lol you found anyway to combat it or just use em as a rest day
 karolobiedzinski i didn t really find a way to handle this better because i quickly feel guilty for not doing enough the problem is when i have such a bad day it feels like it s never going to get better again this makes it hard to just call it a rest day
 codinginflow it s like i m reading an autobiography i m getting use to listening whats going on internally and not feeling guilty for taking breaks when it literally feels like i rather die than keep going that hard part seems to be of balancing of knowing when i should actually take a break or when i m just being lazy can never figure out which is which which is probably where the guilt comes from
 yoooo cif glad to see you here hope you re doing well miss your unity d tutorials but it s okay you should do what interests you
 karolobiedzinski if you feel like this often it s also possible that you re just doing something that doesn t interest you do you generally like what you re doing i never liked studying in school or university for example
 codinginflow i do i just suffer imposter syndrome putting too much pressure on the end result instead of focusing on the day to day process can get overwhelming sometimes especially when your mind starts playing out a really undesirable possible future i actually got a lot better with that though but practicing mindfulness but still so yeah idk gotta fight my battles i guess
 karolobiedzinski maybe you are my lost twin brother i m struggling with the same problems and i am also really into mindfulness so far i haven t really figured out what works long term i tend to hop between different approaches strategies i had the best results so far by setting a strict weekly schedule but i tend to get bored from this over time
 codinginflow i have that too it goes so far that people around me see that too br although it got a little better br br i was grinding until the night and on the following morning until midday i was feeling various levels of stopping emotions from mild depression to mental exhaustion i think it s especially hard on those working with computers since you re constantly looking at screens getting much light in your eyes even in the night br br i m still on the search for what can help br stopping work in the evening and just quot chilling quot kind of helped a bit hustle culture did a lot of damage to us i think i feel guilty for not doing anything i try to suppress those really powerful motivational bursts that come from time to time it helps smooth out the ups and lows br br it s a process
 dannydeboer i agree man sounds like a good strategy
 holy crap you summed up my entire short career
 i completely relate to what you guys are saying br br i always thought i was the only one but in a weird way it s a relief knowing i m not alone in this br br i m finally starting to realise the negative implications of hustle culture nothing is worth sacrificing your mental health for
 codinginflow you nailed it i did this too now i m worried about the long term effects
 all sounds very familiar here as well we re not alone
 jwstreeter kobe bryant worked out days a week hrs a day for years believe me i m not saying you are wrong i m just here for clarity
 traceyhopkins i think there are essential distinctions br br manual versus mental labour where the former is what evolution really designed us for and the latter is quot kind of new quot evolutionary speaking i d say since the industrialization br br kobe bryant david goggins i know incredible people but humans differ very much some are built like brick houses and can work on oil rigs for weeks and weeks on end br i m all about using your full potential and i listened to goggins audio book like times it s not comparable to anything i ever read listened to br br but in the end of the day we are not david goggins and he always says it s not about becoming quot goggins quot life is multi facetted and if one wants to live a healthy live you might have family friends work hobby and all of that br br i m not saying quot hey here are your excuses just lay on the couch and blame it on your balance quot br i m saying we should be really honest to ourselves and hones to our feelings br br i loved hustle culture but it s not an honest culture it puts grind on the top and everything else has to bow down before it that s not the long term game that would be healthy br br i m in my late s and i already burned out once that s not normal and it should never be br br reach for what you want to acomplish but don t forget you are a human br a human linked to a circadian rhythm to a year full of different seasons br br it s not quot always day quot and not quot always night quot and i m not supposed to quot always grind quot or quot always lay on the couch quot br br you re not a machine that runs as long as there is power
 oggytea on point
 mjfuyt i think you recover from it pretty quickly we just have to make sure to not keep repeating that behavior unless it works for us
 i had some really good highly productive days for quite a few years i think i used them all up it s been over six years and it seems like i may have used them all up
 codinginflow absolutely man i learned this way too
 this is a brilliant observation
 quot how much dopamine you experience from something depends on your baseline level when you arrive there and you previous dopamine peaks quot andrew huberman
 i can relate specifically with the spotify playlist i took a cold cut and have found a unique and balanced relationship with music now that its been about a month i dont listen to music in the car or at work much and i thought maybe music is just distracting but after watching this video i can give reason to my decision more i love music but there is definitely a time and place
 would love to see you covering modafinil and its effects as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor br br thanks for the valuable resources you put available for free dr huberman
 see previous episodes
 evilovemetal has he covered modafinil could you tell me which episode if so
 eliadigaetano quot adhd amp how anyone can improve their focus huberman lab podcast quot
 superwiicrazy thanks i didn t know he actually had mentioned them although after paying attention it seems he barely really delves into modafinil more so on ritalin and others i guess it s because we still know very little about it thanks mate
 b what did i learn from this podcast b br br cold showers are essential to my day it can increase dopamine by times equivalent to that of cocaine but instead of having it crash down it maintains after br dopamine is a finite but renewable source this means that if you were to have a big spike in dopamine it comes crashing down but it would go below your baseline this will make you feel worse br if there are activities you want to continue doing avoid stacking dopamine spiking activities together like pre workout music texting and working out if you wanna continue working out the same principle will apply to studying etc br if there is an activity you find difficult like studying dont spike dopamine before and after the activity instead make yourself derive dopamine from the activity studying itself especially when there is a great resistance to the activity tell yourself that despite the activity being hard and difficult you are doing it because you enjoy it br dont spike dopamine prior to engaging in effort and dont spike dopamine after engaging in effort learn to spike dopamine from effort itself andrew huberman br
 this is just amazing dr huberman in a future podcast can you talk about language acquisition
 yes with expert guest
 great podcast might i suggest a number of topics that affect me quite personally that is schizophrenia heightened consciousness delusions of grandeur shamanism and whether mental illness can be greater understood to reduce stigma and perhaps even aid societal evolution cheers
 you would say that shamanism is a mental illness
 davyroger i m not sure that s what i m interested in exploring
 i quot ve been able to change everything in my life inside and out lost kg exercise happiness all of it a better person has stepped in my place only i continue to smoke cigarettes surprisingly after knowing knowledge is knowledge i ll catch myself thinking about the next one as soon as i light up i thank you prof andrew
 i think it would be very informative to understand how thc effects the brain specifically memor since it has been made legal in numerus states i wonder if quality studies have emerged thanks you
 i believe theres is plenty of other studies to this subject
 my rational part quot this podcast is awesome quot br my adhd quot it s endless kill me please quot
 maybe its not adhd but a low dopamine base line
 hear it while running
 i can turn it into organized text for you
 mohammedbenkhelifa it will be awesome thanks a lot
 too funny
 same here i have to skip some parts be strict about topics to attend that are relevant to my present needs and how detailed info is necessary applying that to all the content i spend my valuable free time on
 arthurwittmann who can run for over an hour cause i sure cant
 i have adhd anxiety and depression but for some reason huberman can keep my interest and attention the whole time i watch these intermittently though
 yh same man i want to hear the practical aspect normally he ll write quot the science of quot in the title to show it d more theoretical than practical but not this one
 listen to it on headphones while engaged in other activities whether as suggested running or cleaning or long drive or even better quit social media and while you re dopamine starved from it it ll become much more engaging automatically just sharing what worked for me as a fellow adhd
 listen to it don t watch it at x speed whilst doing other things br br absolutely love these podcasts amp have been binging these on spotify and re listening to them first time i ve attempted to actually watch one and there is no way i d get so much out of this format i also have adhd
 areawoman if you haveadhd listen to it not at x
 andrew reaffirms all this self help hippie dip pie stuff i practice with actual science i love it

 this dopamine masterclass is giving rise to my dopamine levels at least and half times higher than my baseline thank you mr andrew huberman
 its going to backfire in the next video you watch
 this podcast was hugely beneficial to me thanks
 such a great video will have a huge impact on how i structure my day to day activities
 here from your instagram story
 man you re impressive to listen to so much good information thank you for sharing joe
 i got in the habit of exercising first thing in the morning it was my favorite part of the day big energy drink playing my favorite music jogging by the water maybe some weightlifting id feel great during flooded with ideas and inspiration but then afterwards when it came time to sit down at my computer and do some work for the day id feel a bituninspired burned out br br i never put two and two together because ive only heard exercise is supposed to be healthy and great for mindstate br br but i think i may have just had a realization need to shift my schedule around and save some dopamine for mental effort as well
 dave how do you implement that if that is time you have i feel the same way with exercise i feel like i accomplished a lot afterwards but then feel the crash maybe i just need to see exercise as a means to an end and not a reward so i don t get that crash
 lowaimnobrain i agree the energy drink has to go first then you should see if you experience the same effects without the energy drink otherwise there are too many variables dont forget that you also have to enjoy it satisfaction from different forms of exercises are subjective to different people so find what fits you best try some variation in how you move your body and and keep it interesting
 consider on top that there are ultradian rhythms plus your expectation so you re training your body quot at this time we are going to do some great stuff at this time we will sit down and do the grunt work quot so in a way you re training your body to be dull at that time if you sit down to work at your regular running time then go work out at your regular sit down time what happens probably a great computer session and an uninspired workout maybe
 lay off the energy drinks i d say
 i have good results from writing first then exercise not only is my half asleep mind more creative but it s also full of potential energy after my minds fatigued i start exercising to circulate the blood i sort of cycle on and off with writing and exercise but everyones different
 i purely exercise in the morning sometimes with music and i feel even better in the afternoon i think the energy drink might be an overkill
 lowaimnobrain yup that stuff is utter crap worst shit ever invented
 andrewconnor thats a smart take on this
 i had the same so you have to cut the intensity and volume of the workout your neural system ist too overload especially while a longer calorie deficit your neural system is fragile to workouts i do a short min exercise with much sweat then chill and reading meditation journaling before start to work i get my coffee mg not more and than no more tiredness
 austinheyman enjoy it but don t enjoy it too much because then our dopamine spikes a lot which leads to a lower baseline dopamine less energy amp drive that s kind of the message i got in the podcast and i hope i m interpreting it incorrectly because it kind of makes me not want to release much dopamine at all
 energy drinks are so bad for you just go black coffee
 ghostwriter hello can you give us your routine i tried to be a writer too but its so hard to something that mentally demanding but for now i can consistently workout or something physical
 tama sw tn i honestly had to make sure writing was one of the funnest parts of the day br had to put down the video games and phone for awhile br and i just realize alot of ideas that come out could be poop so i just gotta at least be in the habit of writing so that when the creative window appears i ll be ready to write it down i keep a nerdy little note pad on me too incase i get ideas throughout the day some people note things in their phone though br but with exercise i squeeze in sets of my exercises every other day that way i get up to sets a week which appears to be optimal for me at the moment and i also get the rest days that way as well this is what works for me but i hope it helps bro
 psychitsjames i was confused to at first too br but i think the idea is to go goggins in a way br love the pursuit not the reward br and make sure whatever reward you do get isn t like heroin to the human mind or something lol
 ghostwriter ok thankyou for the reply
 why so much hate towards energy drinks those things keep me alive unfortunately br br for your situation try sugar free energy drinks and you won t have the sugar spike and calories but only the good stuff occasionally try working out without an energy drink and listening to an audiobook for example or not listening to anything if you still need caffeine to kickstart your workout then buy mg caffeine pills and pop one or two min before a workout basically vary all of the good feel things you do that associate with workouts
 you just the dreamer with a jogging habit you should look in to discipline not how to save some dopamine
 ditch the energy drink get a standing desk and treadmill perhaps
 thats exactly what i do then pooped out after lunch and before all my boring sit down activities hard when you have add because you need the dopamine elevation but then you get the crash the whole concept of pushing the so called envelope was fascinatingly captured in the classic book flowers for algernon
 de
 i do exactly this however i drink a med black coffee additionally i practice meditation almost daily and i fast from time to time both omad and hours a month that s my prescription for good health
 b oh man this comment and self realization spoke to me precisely and personally light bulb moment b
 that was fantastic i would love a scientific video on estrogen progesterone supplementation for over year old women the ideal time to start etc
 ah me too i have listened to some menopause videos but i d love a huberman science take on it
 i m my sister is my younger sister is none of us including our mother when she was alive ever took a single dose of any kind of hormone therapy women have been going through menopause since the beginning of time it s as natural as breathing giving birth etc etc besides who wants to ingest the urine of pregnant mares lol that s what it s made of it s also incredibly cruel to the horses they re chained in a standing only stall their entire lives artificially inseminated a tube inserted in their ureter to collect urine as soon as they give birth the babies are killed and they re artificially impregnated again the urine that gets collected is dehydrated and compressed into a pill form so when you swallow it with water you re rehydrating the urine sounds yummy doesn t it anyway just thought you should know there are many many women who never take hormone replacement therapy and do just fine matter of fact i m happier now than i ve ever been in my life i really don t know why but it could have something to do with being in menopause or it could be something else all i know is none of the women in my family ever used hormone replacements and i personally am quite happy and well adjusted i m not sure women really need that replacement or if it s a man thing where they think we should take it and like i said women have been surviving menopause for thousands of years matter of fact i think this latest generation is actually the first to take a horse pee pill lol to alleviate something that is as natural as breathing
 matthewsbrrful not all hrt is from horses

 i am really grateful for this podcast the reward section was an enlightening moment for me as a devoted aikido practitioner and discovering the true genius of its creator br as an ardent supporter of intermittent fasting and cold showers it was a real dopamine kick to watch and listen to this podcast
 get a load of this guy
 id love to have you do an episode on adhd and how this info applies specifically to our dopamine lacking brains
 do you also have adhd
 dhruvvansrajrathore i do i also looked back at his videos and found he did have videos on the subject
 idliketobaremytestimony cindyjoy melander i see i hope you are doing fine
 the dopamine reset taking an extended break from something makes sense as a way to bring your dopamine system back but doesn t it also enable that system to provide the kind of rewards that led you to needing the break in the first place i guess you d have to change those behaviors too otherwise the reset is just a reset not also a redirect if you will
 can you do a podcast on oxytocin loneliness and maintaining healthy relationships
 hii doctor huberman br br i have been a regular listener to your podcasts and can t thank you enough for your contribution br br i have a question with reference to the famous rhonda byrne book the secret which talks about manifestation of desires by application of the law of attraction visualisation positive affirmations gratitude etc what is the impact of these on our body and mind does it help in achieving our goals faster is the success rate in goal achievement higher is this all or some of this backed by science br br eagerly waiting to hear back from you br br thanks
 christinegreig not yet have posted on insta as well
 thank you so much for sharing your knowledge i should be among the happiest people on earth rich are my blessings and many are my opportunities and talents but depression has cursed my life and made it really difficult for me to find joy im tired of the medication push antidepressants have not really helped me understanding more about how dopamine works gives me renewed hope and a desire to keep pursuing better mental health
 i ve been through everything including cptsd i used wellbutrin years not for depression but focus work overload br i secluded myself several years for introspection i became my own therapist i finally resolved childhood trauma and adult trauma from a psychopath it took years but depression is out of my life it s odd for me to listen why dopamine can fix our lives granted domapine is necessary for overall state of mind but as a cure all that s bizarre to me self analysis tied to childhood bs is the the tough road to inner peace and productivity based on experience
 monday has turned into one of the best days of the week bc of this podcast
 dr huberman has fixed mondays i thought it couldn t be done
 a few questions br br you mention yerba matte tea as a source of caffeine with the added benefit of having neuroprotective effects particularly in regards to dopamine receptor protection however when i research yerba matte tea i quickly come across the potentially carcinogenic properties of this tea id like to hear your thoughts on this br br in regards to cold water exposure and its effect on increasing dopamine up to x baseline how does this relate to an eventual dopamine crash back down to below baseline like other highly dopaminergic behaviors substances you talk about combining caffeine with music and a favorite preworkout while undergoing a workout and how this might slowly over time drop ones baseline dopamine level and so rather one should implement an intermittent dopamine schedule to mitigate this effect does this also apply to cold exposure if one was to do cold exposure on a regular basis would it lead to the same baseline lowering effect br br regarding the various substances mentioned that can increase dopamine mucuna pruriens l tyrosine phenylethylamine huperzine a can you clarify what increase means how do they increase dopamine do they stimulate the release of dopamine from the vesicles you mention or do they stimulate the production and replenishment of dopamine in those vesicles additionally can these substances be leveraged in some way to mitigate the crash effect one experiences following a highly dopaminergic event like a cocaine binge asking for a friend br br are there any substances that increase the production and replenishment of dopamine in the vesicles but do not stimulate the release of dopamine the thought here is how to replenish dopamine quickly without stimulating the release and further contributing to the problem br br thank you for everything you do ive learned so much from your podcast and i can honestly say its changed and improved my life cheers
 i was wondering if you could increase your dopamine stores too that would be amazing and a great way to mitigate increased dopamine release in a modern setting
 thanks and god bless you indeed you ve increased our knowledge
 a maybe it s only carcinogenic if it is hot like most beverages because it burns your esophagus
 cristianhenriquez yerba mate consumption is associated with lung cancer as well as mouth and throat cancer yerba mate contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs since it is smoked during processing it can also contain high levels of manganese
 i was wondering the same things about cold shower
 rhyothemisprinceps also has been used daily by healthy people for hundreds of years don t skip that part
 martinocruzcruz there have been epidemiological studies showing elevated risk of cancer associated with frequent yerba mate consumption there are some cigarette smokers who live to if one feels lucky or doesn t care have at it
 rhyothemisprinceps noo you serious i drink it every day
 normaland yeah it s unfortunate i used to drink it the cancer associations were found in men not women if that s any reassurance
 i am so so so grateful for this channel he is changing lives
 i haven t played a game i ve been addicted to for over a month and since then picked up painting with watercolor again i d like to start adding exercise to the mix but it feels amazing that i m not wasting time playing a game to get that dopamine hit but rather learning and creating things there are still times when i feel a really bad urge to install the game despite having my longtime account deleted already so i go watch someone s minute gameplay on youtube and that helps me move on from that urge i also watch an episode or two of anime before bed now instead of playing and that helps relax me and i ve managed to have a few nights of really good sleep here and there hopefully that improves further because my sleeping habits have been abysmal ever since my cat passed away adding grief to the mix of my already having anxiety and depression
 you re doing great mate one day at a time i m not sure if you ve seen any other of dr huberman s podcasts but he has episodes on many things including depression anxiety habits mediation and sleep his speciality some are interviews with other specialists some very interesting stuff
 sorry for your loss your cat looks a lot like mine br i replaced being an alcoholic with playing dark souls games so i still get dopamine but in a less harmful way i also paint miniatures for gaming when i feel i need to balance out the playstation obsession i don think you have to totally quit your gaming it s all about balance
 destroyleftists i still play a couple of rpg games you re right about balance and that s why i decided to have my league of legends account deleted i always had trouble moderating how much i played it to begin with and after my cat passed i thought playing it would help tire me out to fall asleep earlier but would end up playing till morning so i ended up getting even less sleep i was more irritable and had trouble articulating sentences and was forgetting things like crazy so i think cutting that particular game out of my life was the best thing i could do for my health i don t think i ll ever quit playing games entirely and i think it s great they can do something like it did for you getting you off something harmful like alcohol but like you said balance is very important and i m learning that now
 kiwitigress the video he made on grief showed up on my recommended so i watched that one before this one it was really good and helped me understand what i was going through better i have a few more opened that looked interesting and i ll be checking those out too
 alexgraycat
 alexgraycat i m so glad that genuinely useful information is now getting to the people who need it i am a breast cancer survivor just recovering from a preventative mastectomy as i type who is now researching everything i can do to make myself as healthy as possible this dude is really bringing me joy right now i sincerely wish you the best for your learning and healing journey you got this
 kiwitigress i m sorry you had to go through that i ve seen stuff about intermittent fasting clean keto diet helping with preventing stopping getting rid of cancer might be something worth looking into if you haven t already hope you stay well
 alexgraycat already way ahead of you andrew did a video on intermittent fasting and after watching that and his chat with david sinclair my fave vid do far it solidified the research i d already done that fasting and possibly some keto could be a huge tool i can t do full on keto much as the fat does me in i ve had my gall bladder out but i do the restricted window eating and am working on my sleep and fitness and even a spot of meditation because why the hell not i may look into ox bile which can help with the gall bladder issue but will see apparently andrew has an upcoming video soon on cancer itself so looking forward to that i think i m a bit of a huberman junkie at the moment
 kiwitigress oh really i ll check that video out i personally haven t had any run in with cancer yet but i think it s good to be prepared especially since several relatives family friends have passed away from it
 alexgraycat can t say i recommend it so many things i d rather do than faffing about dealing with cancer especially twice but i am very lucky so far and on the road to better health check out the david sinclair one in the meantime as that is on longevity so covers a few of the same preventative bases i would imagine would definitely pay to look after yourself if it s in the family
 quot in those moments of the most intense friction br you tell yourself this is very painful br and because it s painful br it will evoke an increase in dopamine release later br meaning it will increase my baseline in dopamine br but you also have to tell yourself br that in that moment you are doing it by choice br and you re doing it because you love it quot andrew huberman
 around
 around
 i ve always said we are all just addicts whether it be drugs religion exercise meditation ect and it s us to choose our addictions wisely this completely makes sense of my theory
 now i understand why being an amateur musician is more rewarding than being a professional it always seems that when you play just for the love of the game you enjoy it more
 bingo thanks laura i needed to hear this
 that means it s best to be a professional amateur hehe getting dopamine from the enjoyment of the music work itself also most professional artists tend to be unimpressed with their work but can still find joy in observing they are progressively getting better at it for a long time i hated people saying that being happy is a choice because i didn t understand it now we know by changing our behaviors we can also modify what and when something makes us happy
 i m a youtuber watcher and i m professor of tuning into andrew hubermans videos the moment theyre uploaded
 can also see why it was really hard to focus and enjoy school videos games and getting out of school are all kids can think about and this explains it lol
 you have made monday my favorite day of the week
 i havent finished the entire episode yet but i got through the section where he listed the gradations of dopamine escalation from things like nicotine or cocaine or meth but can anyone confirm level elevations from alcohol or cannabis two much more commonly used substances than meth i would imagine
 no idea but i want to know as well
 those dopamine levels are way too high try to avoid that
 learning this at feels awesome genuinely so interesting
 same bro we are the only people in our schools who know this stuff
 andrew excellent vid thanks br i ice bath at c to start each day you re totally right it generates huge confidence can do do it now clarity action for an hour or two you can ignore the rest of the day or week or year br it defines me it is who i am and who i want to be known as don t mess with me kinda image br here s a nice little present for you and readers relevant at
 hello bruce thank you so much for your comment i have a question for you i think i have big troubles with dopamine phone addiction and struggle to be even a little bit productive even easy tasks are incredibly hard even when i start and push through for a long time i still keep quitting i think this points to a big dopamine problem br br my strategy is to become very radical starting from tomorrow gathering some more practical information today so far i have decided br br stop using a smartphone alltogether for about two months at least maybe longer br exercise every morning br have cold showers every morning br i don t know which is better to do first i think cold showers br eat some eggyolks and small amounts of coffee br cut out sugar from my diet it really does make my brain foggy for between and hours br try to actively enjoy the very process of hard work br br now i finally come to my question how do i do point the best way here is my idea focuing on the friction and enjoying the friction so it evokes dopamine how can i do that focus on how much i want to have that skill i really do want it and how great it is and feels to be in the process of building it up br br do you think this will work br br would there be anything in my plan you would change or something you would add br br many thanks in advance
 essennagerry good on you i exercise first thing in the day before ice bath after the bath although i m very zingy with energy but the cold seems to deprive me of good sustained energy level for running or weights etc same regarding eating better to exercise with good clean empty stomach running in ancient times we often had to run after prey on an empty stomach and had clearer head etc when hungry even in the for to eight hours after eating i feel weaker and uncomfortable doing physical work digesting food is itself work for the body in addition to the exertion br i m myself new to the idea of cultivating enjoyment of the struggle the duress but the way i ll do it will be my usual creation of visualizations about myself and affirmations declarations of self definition that shape my self attitude and indeed my very identity i ve already firmly defined myself as a person tough enough to ice bath every day fast hours a day exercise almost every day etc i ve created all kinds of images and videos that automatically appear on my pc background telling me who i am who do you actually want to be what kind of a person can you picture yourself like that do a google to find images that inspire it and if possible past yourself into those pictures extremely powerful effect br truly the ice bath after months gradually getting used to it isn t that much of a hardship i especially have used distraction to reduce the suffering i always sing a brave seafaring song i focus on developing excellent diction for public speaking in future and being in tune despite some gasps that distort my breathing i always also though still also study think what s happening to me and use the discoveries to steer future events br i m bemused by the smart phone habit i would have thought you could set yourself policies less drastic e g a chain of habit that only gives you an hour of it before you have to do something else like going to work or cooking dinner personally i use my pc all day long prob about hours a day it s both serious work constant crucial learning and also fun like social networking which develops my thoughts i take good breaks i set up a break reminder to happen every hour and often obey it not addicted i m highly fired up by other activities like renovating going out
 brucethomson thank you very much for your reply it s very helpful br br as for the phone habit sadly i ve tried less drastic measures and i keep sliding back to the old habits using my phone for quot fun stuff quot many hours over my intent and it s not even fun anymore that s why i think i should be drastic at least for a little while then when my dopamine is better regulated i will use my smartphone again but with restrictions which i ll actually stick to haha br br thank you very much for these ideas some were new to me and it s helpful
 how does dopamine relate to deep focus flow states i m thinking about how the brain loves being in those states i m wondering if the way by which it loves them is through dopamine release being in flow seems to be naturally pleasant and we don t need to trick ourselves into liking that kind of effort as described in the growth mindset protocols
 reposting timestamps for those who can t see them among the links below video br sorry i do not know how to copy them with highlighted times that go directly to that location on the video but this still helps br timestamps br
 thank you

 the problem with increasing dopamine through supplements like mucuna is that when u stop taking the supplement your dopamine will be even lower br these supplements are only handy if you accutely try to increase dopamine for a big event its rly bad to be in a limbo where your dopamine is going up and down
 good point additionally measuring dopamine and other neurotransmitter levels isn t something that can be done without imaging like pet scan and or invasive procedures

 my ancestor b resting feet in a cool stream b br andrew huberman s ancestor quot come brother there is work to be done quot
 something tells me your parents and grandparents didn t had kids and survived by simply resting their feet in a cool stream

 unfortunately i had to disagree on caffeine topic br in my experience coffee addiction cause it is kinda like a drug had negative effect on my mood sleep etc it was my quot go to drink quot to get shit done i had been drinking coffee for years or so everyday in various forms coffee mate even tea i stumbled upon videos with testimionals about caffeine withdrawal i was scared but also curious about side effects and benefits that might come with caffeine free life i went cold turkey and struggled with motivation and mood for weeks first two weeks were horrible it s months caffeine free my digestion dramatically improved i sleep like a baby and have dreams every night i don t have to drink coffee every time i had to do something to get me going br br it is not just my experience in my opinion i wouldn t treat caffeine that good and gentle it is drug like br br i rarely comment on videos but had to throw that in thanks so much for your videos these are life changing for me i recommend them to everyone priceless content mr huberman
 did you replace it with something else
 iamavoyager no i do not consume caffeine in any form i have a lot more energy which is stable throughout the day i don t experience anxiety which happened almost everyday i love coffee and mate i really do but i do not plan to drink any caffeinated stuff probably ever
 keatsu i seem to be using coffee as a stimulant for adhd i don t experience high but a stability on coffee but i gotta consume like six cups if i were to sustain moderate focus it s intense but i don t know much else to do
 iamavoyager check episode on adhd man dr huberman covers a lot of stuff br on the coffee topic i ve heard people vary in terms of caffeine digestion and body reaction it could be some kind of gene responsible i might be that one unlucky person adhd on the other hand is another animal you should check out adhd episode take care man
 keatsu already did halfway through it and then i finished the dopamine podcast in typical adhd fashion make of that what you will
 sure it is the same like others drugs like nootropics you should be aware and try do not consume always like alcohol because time to time it becomes an addiction and you base level drops like huffman says it is better do fasting with nootropics you do the same week off month or whatever you need to restore your baseline br br now i m doing mate for almost every day i was off for month and just days was bad however it is not the same year to everyday every addiction is it eventually except the hard ones which give you huge hits and short peaks
 i am yr old teenager boy and i think this is going to help me alot thankyou
 i have a question does up regulation of d or d receptors make a substantial difference because what amount of dopamine is released does not change just the accessibility in terms of being bio available so how significant is the up regulation of the receptors in the larger picture and my second question is how does light make a difference in the baseline dopamine levels can it also cause peaks
 me motivated to clean my room br my mom quot go clean your room quot br my dopamine drops immediately
 because your psyches development is stuck in the toddler stage of i wanna do it for myself generally over controlling parents cause this the way to get over it is to remove the weight youve added to your moms words like pretend its just background noise and continue with what you were going to do itll feel forced for awhile but soon itll feel natural and second nature

 jordan peterson quot go clean your room quot br my dopamine raises immediately
 andrew given that you say dopamine impacts how much external interaction we seek is there any correlation causation between dopamine and introvertness extrovertness
 fascinating that so much of this seems to reinforce some eastern philosophy ideas embrace the suffering of the moment for what it is be comfortable with experiencing suffering as life is comprised of both suffering and joy the goal is not to seek happiness in itself but to let it emerge from the pursuit of meaningful effortful things the pursuit of pleasure reward for its own sake is counter productive and ultimately self destructive this reinforces dr gilbert s work on happiness as well
 does this mean that always being in a state of happiness satisfaction is practically impossible since you will always experience a drop in dopamine after a release being happy and that this will eventually lead to your dopamine being depleted depression burnout or is happiness related to different circuitry than purely dopamine release so that one can be quot happy quot even without having elevated dopamine levels
 great question would love to hear the answer
 i think dopamine is more involved with motivation instead of happiness you cant be motivated all the time dopamine influences happiness but its just one factor
 good question i hope to hear a response in a future podcast
 pleasure joy and contentment are all unique mental artifacts they often co occur which can lead to their conflation both conceptually and phenomenologically however upon analysis or contemplation we can isolate these threats as distinct states i would say that contentment and joy are not necessarily dependent on dopamine levels because they are focused on what one already possesses either physically philosophically or in one s memory according to dr huberman these interoceptive states provoke less of a dopamine release than the type of pleasure that is stimulated from external sources it s like simple hedonism vs gratitude
 znorfel me too
 happiness can also mean being at peace with one self not necessarily blissing just chillin am i right
 to add andrei s question actually sits quite well with one of the main precepts of buddhism i e that in life there will be suffering the antidote non attachment seems like a way to counter the drop in dopamine or to stop the scale from tipping towards pain in excess perhaps an idea for an episode the scientific mechanisms underlying buddhism i know there s some research being done in psychology related to this
 znorfel yes i d also be interested in a podcast episode like this however more broadly on how different monastic practices affect people and how things such as asceticism and the denial of pleasure affect the release of different hormones neurotransmitters
 andrei uf hi that d be absolutely fascinating please dr huberman hear our prayers
 we have to move with nature as the tree ripens to produce the fruit there is energy in yoga we say rajas there is that moment when the fruit is ripe and that is satvic pure energy pure balance and contentment then eventually it recedes into tamas where there is stillness and a state of inertia rotting and releasing back into the ground we ride the process nature shows you expand and then recede this is the way be content in all of its phases
 depends on the intensity you can definitely achieve a constant state of content but not quot happiness quot per se
 yahooisnotg i get you i guess i look at peace over happiness as its so fleeting and peace feels more sustainable
 no huberman clearly says that you establish a baseline level of dopamine and the levels can vary but its the baseline that matters in the long term which can be gradually built up the swings you get will vary drastically on your lifestyle getting a slight dip from having a good time out with your friends is managable and practically un noticeable getting massive dips from amphetamine usage and other toxic addiction behaviors can damage this base line for a long time
 andrei depends on your definition of happiness there are many mind states that can equate to feelings of happiness i e happily satisfied with status quo serotonin happiness after sex prolactin happiness after satiety idk maybe leptin dopamine serotonin happily fulfilled after a workout maybe dopamine amp serotonin idk br but yah many types of hapoiness and no i m fairly certain not all as a result of dopamine
 i think happiness should never be the goal peace of mind taking life one day at a time keep moving and improving should be

 great video my youtube addiction finally pushed me into something actually useful
 oops you had a spike be aware of the drop in baseline afterwards
 packling just dropped everything to watch this and thursdays event is directly related to my field will find time to attend
 lol again with the pilot v hahaha
 thats so weird i remember when i was young we used to take trips to lake superior in the early spring and it would still be damn cold like maybe out but the water would be around degrees and we would go swimming it took like mins but eventually you got used to it and i still vividly remember those times as being some of the best interesting take on the cold water stuff made me think of that
 have you ever thought of interviewing wim hoff i have been practicing the cold showers and breathing exercises for close to a year snd i feel great the shower definitely gives me a boost every morning
 colleague at stanford expert on cold physiology here at hlp soon

 hello doctor huberman will there ever be an episode on acne the main causes and how to treat it i know it s not his main field but i m pretty desperate is there anyone who can advise me of sources from which i can study equal to the level of doctor huberman
 dr ken berry acne my skin used to be horrible but people comment on it now all that time that it s super clear they often think i m wearing makeup also the what i ve learned youtube channel
 no there wont hes not a dermatologist find a dermatologist to get you on a treatment plan there is a cure for acne its called isotretinoin a dermatologist will prescribe you this after other treatments have failed
 andrew quot it turns out quot huberman love this guy
 this is what we really wanted
 on today s episode dr huberman puts the dope in dopamine

 thanks
 practical summary br br dopamine management br abstain from or limit highly desirable activities for up to a month so the dopamine levels are replenished and the baseline dopamine release returns to normal br peaks of dopamine decrease our baseline dopamine required to general motivation and satisfaction with life br go for intermittent random releases of dopamine br don t bundle pleasurable activities with things you want to do gym and music br flip a coin and choose how much pleasure bundling you ll do to the next activity br otherwise the activity alone becomes less pleasurable br br direct practices br cold water exposure x increase and sustained for hours afterwards br peaks br chocolate x br sex x act and pursuit of it br nicotine x br cocaine x br amphetamine x br exercise x up to x the more you enjoy it subjectively br coffee combined with another activity coffee makes the dopamine release more effective br connection with other people br br mental strategies br subjectivity perception and belief br hearing something that validates our belief about an activity makes it more pleasurable br journaling thinking positively about something you remember or you re experiencing now releases dopamine br learn to spike dopamine from effort br don t spike dopamine prior to engaging in effort br don t spike dopamine after engaging in effort br learn to spike dopamine from effort itself
 i am interested what your thoughts are on the claims that yerba mate contains pah a carcinogen in which studies show can affect the reproductive and immune systems in addition to increasing the risk of cancer there are several benefits you speak about regarding yerba mate and i am interested in adding into my daily routine but these negative affects on pah give me some pause
 i think this is a fantastic question hope it gets answered on the next pod
 try unsmoked yerba mate if you re concerned with pah
 i drink yerba almost every day and i am aware of this carcinogene stuff in it i informed myself and found out that only the smoke dried yerba is dangerous thats why i drink only air dried yerba the info i found was just found in some articles so i can t say it is really true i wish there was some study or expert that could tell his views

 roberts o how does it work im curious
 this dude has helped me so much got my mom with parkinsons listening as well thank you and hes handsome which is a plus
 the notification for this podcast spiked my dopamine
 a question andrew please do ssris and or anti psychotics negatively impact dopamine hence leaning towards anhedonia
 some can yes depends on the compounds usually not ssris though but is possible
 hubermanlab i was thinking more along the lines of olanzapine for example thanks for the response by the way
 for all my indian folks the crux of this podcast is quot karam vo karo jo karna hi fal lage quot
 nice
 care to translate
 iineedskins a rough translation would be quot do the work which itself feels like the reward quot
 tanayachavre spot on
 tanayachavre thank you similar to the mindset quot embrace the grind quot
 its insane how closely this stuff aligns with buddhism
 this basic truth exists amongst most all religions the institutions that control these religions attempt to suppress this truth
 the thing that blows my mind is how feeling intense pain leads to heightened dopamine after and the intensity is directly correlated hence why jesus became enlightened after fasting and im sure similar examples exist in buddhism and other religions
 is buddhism dope i din now my room mates do this they be smockin bud day adn nite
 so would cold showers actually be bad for our long term dopamine levels around
 i think he talks about it more in depth in another video i think it has to do with cortisol release stress response but im only halfway through this video i will finish watching through that time stamp so i can explain properly within the context
 adaptation is the issue i believe but i have a strong feeling that it would take a long time to get used to the cold to that extent
 hey dr would you consider an episode on sad winter is coming for us canadians
 buy the highest lumens or kelvin units not same light bulbs you can and use light b fixtures b that allow you to use brighter bulbs many light fixtures may only allow you to use or watt bulbs and that might not be enough case by case its a cheap quick fix you certainly want bulbs over lumens but higher is better especially before noon simulating daylight is closer to to i think but i get lux lumens and kelvin confused a bit for cost savings long fluorescent daylight bulbs used for growing plants used in regular kitchen fixtures may be best br i bought a pack watt equivalent actually uses watts that b says b it is lumens at walmart a walmart brand at a decent price many companies claims aren t accurate and i doubt walmart s are but the bulbs are still far brighter than those i had before but there are bulbs closer to or that are about each and may be worth it br i could get horrible sad and lived in the southern usa br i think he should do such an episode too
 can reading fiction books watching tv serials cause dopamine peaks and decreased baseline dopamine
 yeah i experienced the decreased baseline dopamine
 video idea oxytocin and serotonin next
 i m gonna take a stonedy guess and wonder if its that humans and humanoids usually would have only encountered and bathed in cool and cold waters for most of our evolution for that effect to have evolved vs the comfy hot plumbing we have today
 dropping a video while it s pm in australia guess i gotta watch it
 could you use dopamine drugs to help with success if use only to pursue success
 b in a dark alley b br br psst you want some cold shower

 can you talk about the chemistry and biology of boredom
 just bought dr lembke s book

 i know i pictured some very inappropriate species sex
 i ve always thought that the way he spelled was the correct one but i ve heard it differently so many times that i ve convinced myself that other way was the right one
 he obviously meant anti vaxxers they are another species

 what is your opinion on grounding also known as earthing and your opinion on heavy blankets
 i have been practicing grounding for about months now about i sit in nature while i meditate barefooted and i find the whole experience kind of addictive so much that i used to miss a day or two of meditation in between during the week i have been meditating or practicing mindfulness for years now but since doing grounding i have not skipped a day its a strange sensation that i can only say is a wonderful therapeutic part of my day that i really look forward to doing my mindset is much lighter since practicing grounding if that makes sense now the tough part is i live in the northeast and i am wondering how i can keep this going in the winter months probably going to have to do the copper spike wire through the window take care
 thank you
 watched the whole video feel so dejected of myself gotta change my life
 happy belated birthday andrew

 this argument summary as a stoner your brian gives dopamine less and less until you dont receive anymore
 i agree
 this makes my recent burnout make sense
 thanks for the connection with best regards
 best dopamine video ever
 good stuff
 subtitles would really help as for someone like me whose mother tongue is not english
 thank you lt
 please somebody tell me if i got it right im no scientific at all and not even english if i eat my favourite breakfast i can potentially receive points of happiness if i watch a fun vido i can also potentially receive points of happiness but my body cannot produce more than points of happiness at a time so if i eat my favourite breakfast and watch a fun video my body will register that eating my favourite will just produce points of happiness for the next time br did i get it right
 very interesting what you mentioned here about fasting and how it is connected with dopamine i am a muslim and we fast the whole mo th of ramadan becasue god allah commanded us to do so and we do it to please and closer to god allah and the benefit comes with it becasue he created us he knows whats better of us in terms of physical and spiritual i would suggest anyone who reads this comment look into islam a little deeper and you will find the most perfect way of life
 would anyone please tell the link of research at

 why did you receive thorazine for guardia was it a mistake
 i have a question if anybody wants to answer why now a days people are more interested in watching minute reels instead of such knowledgeable time taking vedios does it have anything to do with dopamine why our new generation doesnt have patience amp focus please share your knowledge
 andrew has answered this br yes it has to do with dopamine with the creation of short videos especially tiktok the overstimulation we have been given accustoms us to that level of dopaminergic levels it is way more satisfying to watch multiple second videos that would engage with you than to sit amp listen to a hour video
 perfect

 apples are trees they should be respected and not taken enough is enough daddy point taken can i go now be back in a snap
 wtf how do you increase baseline naturally though
 i cannot escape the conclusion that what this entire model establishes is basically a guide on how to methodically deceive oneself into a happy slave mentality embracing hoi polloi that will take enjoyment from activities that a natural human being would find less than optimal by default rewards exist for a reason you are being paid for your work for a reason strive for work that offers better rewards do not be a drone that derives enjoyment from things it would naturally hate and happily accept medicore remuneration
 how do i chose dopamine
 gracias

 is it wasn t for bad days you wouldn t recognize the good ones

 so do you want to have a low or high dopamine baseline
 you want a high medium baseline not too high because your dopamine levels will crash bringing them much lower than they were before but also you do not want your dopamine baseline to be low because dopamine relates to how you feel meaning the lower your baseline the less happy you will be
 jamesjobbings thank you for replying brother so high medium baseline without peaking thanks man
 why do i feel like a very sciency but slightly less buff and scary jocko willink is talking to me

 bruh
 hard work is hard

 i ve been reading james clear atomic habits which encourages making a habit attractive so that you are more likely to stick with it temptation bundling pairing an activity that gives a strong dopamine hit with something you don t necessarily want to do but are trying to build a new habit on is this just absolute nonsense

 pursue non prescription drugs or sold over the counter
 this video is translation hindi please

 i dont get why andrew huberman say at tool for the quote which was i this is very painful and because its painful it will evoke an increase in dopamine release later why later thoigh
 bedankt

 any monk will tell you all this be it christian buddhist or hindu take any religion all of them have holy months or days during which people deny themsleves and are able to lift the baseline dopamine levels what we as ordinary people do is wait for the last day of the holy month when our denial gets over then indulge in an orgy of drinking feasting and sex and try to layer on as many activities as possible to get the next high br quot he has scaled the mountains of ignorance he is about to conquer the highest peak as he pulls himself over the final rock he is greeted by a band of theologians who have been sitting there for centuries quot

 i want to watch more of your videos but theyre way too long hrs and min come on

 please interview david goggins
 hello social media addiction

 i want to watch it but its hours lol also i watched another video where it stated that dopamine was the bad guy and we should focus on serotonine instead as dopamine was responsible for addictions hence bad things while serotonin was responsible for happiness but this video says dopamine is responsible for motivation focus and satisfaction it is confusing br br i would love some summary because two hours of alot of new information i might need to watch it a few times instead to get actual insight on the video br br i lack motivation myself often but i am not addicted to anything i dont understand it i used to dring alcohol like beers and sometimes vodka or else but i stopped it i prob had beer in the last two months i dont use my phone as much anymore and keep it turned off most of the time i dont smoke and dont do drugs i only need a solution how to stay motivated on studying and not have this i study for month and then leave it for some time because inside me i feel a bit of regret for the time i spent before for studying it is like i have invested something and threw it away now br br i know motivation comes from within and there is chemistry responsible in the brain for these activities to keep going and thats why i browse videos for them but this video has huge and contradictory info br br i just want to know do more of this and less of this and will be better i dont even use my playstation anymore so to say i like reading books but what i want is to be able to want something in the long term and my motivation not to expire after a month or two i know this will make me happy but am not sure why my motivation dies overtime br br br edited i scrolled forward and i agree stress is huge element in motivation to change i mean the two occasions i actively looked to change and do something new was when i thought i might get released from work which caused stress in me which caused me to look for alternatives but the motivation part at

 lol i ll tell you how i feel after wasting minutes listening to the useless intro but more on that later br i have a suggestion how about a quot short quot session on what happens when we breath the aluminum the parasites of humanity are spraying on us in the chemtrails aircraft are spraying br you know the blood brain barrier how the covid jab crosses the blood brain barrier and it s devastating effects br as i skimmed through the video you touched on sugar in a couple sentences you could have elaborated what it does to the brain br i just did a youtube search and found this ten minute video br serotonin vs dopamine key differences between pleasure and happiness br br it is more informative than your two hour video and shorter than your intro lol br br some people just like to hear themselves talk off to a psychology lesson
 please about love
 i just dont get the percent terminology around above the baseline concept regarding sex dr huberman said at

 br
 what is this advertising in the middle br completly distruct one s focus
 if i m being with ya these are not useful at all not practical there are thousands of comments saying this is so useful and stuff but i grantee those mfs don t even hit the gym lol bunch of nerds who can t understand that information overload is not a healthy thing
 is this sounds the devils work
 way to much advertising

 you could have cut the length of this in half by not repeating the same thing times you are painfully long winded


 all these hour videos can be cut short to half an hour the unnecessary usage of quot technical quot and quot science quot jargon pretentious low pitch voice and the intimidating dark background is getting boring br br notice the key takeaway of the topic increasing dopamine naturally is conveniently missing

 hello
 jnjkn

 leaving at
 i think this is a whole bunch of mumbo jumbo anybody else
 he s explaining the science behind delaying gratification dopamine addiction is behind most of the world s problems
 samstone i think youre wrong br just for example that more than out of americans use antidepressants is part of dopamine addiction problem every teenager in the west is addicted to dopamine and its only getting worse
 this is nonsense i was a crystal meth addict for many years quit went to school graduated dean s list br some people are just losers
 with all due respect i think that you should stick to science and research and leave philosophy and psychology be
 no
 not a single person asked
 im not listening to you whos just another person on youtube blabbering about what they think they know
